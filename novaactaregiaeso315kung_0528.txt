When so many different opinions have been pronounced concer-
ning the seat of the pathological process in arsenical paralysis, a descrip-
tion of the case in question may be of interest.

The history of the illness is as follows:

Α Case of Arsenical Paralysis.

MaJ'a Lisa Blomster. (married.) age 49. Taken into my clinic
in the Academical Hospita] ΨΑ 1883, died ΠΜ 1883.

History. Amongst the patient's relations an aunt when young had·

Ι epileptic fits, which however gradually ceased with advancing years. The

patient's condition of life has been fairly good, in her youth she worked
hard but she has not of late years done any fatiguing work. At the-
age of 8 or 10 9119 had her first epileptic fit, at 14 1119 next and

years. Menstruation commenced when she was 19, then ceased for a

soles of the feet, and when she walked she thought she felt something
like needles between her feet and 1119 floor. The following morning
