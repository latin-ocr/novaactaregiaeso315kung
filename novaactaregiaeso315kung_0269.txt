EcnluoscrAMus PUSILLus. 33

different developmental stages, one is soon convinced of this fact, Pl.
III, fiq 50—57. As far as I knoW‚ Pr0uh02) alone seems to have ob-
served something similar in Dorocidaris papillata. Concerning the time
when the mesenchyme originates in the Echinoderms7 the following opi-
nion prevails. In Echinoids, Ophiurids and Cucumaria (planci) the me-
senchyme arises earliest, i. e. during the blastula stage, and in Holo—
thuria (tubulos-a> it makes its appearance with the first indication of
the archenteron. In Asteroids, Crinoids and Synapta on the contrary
the mesenchyme cells take their origin from the end of the fully grown
archenteron. If We take this for granted⁷ Dorocidaris and Echinocyamus
should make an interesting exception, the wandering cells being loosened
from the entoderm during the whole process of invagination from the
blastula stage to the full-sized Gastrula.

I may be allowed here to give in a few words my own opinion
With regard to the origin of the mesenchyme in the Echinoderms, which
is founded mainly on my investigations of Echinocyamus.

1) With very few exceptions, the mesenchyme originates from the
entoderm alone and by means of immigration, and further investi-
gations will probably prove that the formation of mesenchyme in
many Echinoderms goes on not only during the blastula stage but
uninterruptedly also during the whole gastrulation. Of course
this is not the case in the Asteroids, Orinoids and Synapta, where
the immigration only commences When the archenteron is almost
grown. With regard to its origin by means of delamination, as
is supposed to be the case in Amphiura squamata and Psolinus
brevis, we seem to need more detailed accounts, before it is

’ taken for granted.

2> The mesenchyme arises earliest, with very few exceptions, in
those groups of Echinoderms, in Which the larvae have the ske-
leton earliest developed. Most of the first entering cells are
calciferous.

3> No bilaterally arranged arche-mesenchyme cells are to be detected.

· 4) No true mesenchyme bands, homologous to the mesodermic bands
in Annelids, Mollusks etc„ are met with in the Echinoderms, but
often, especially in the Echinoids, the first wandering cells which
enter, arrange themselves in two bilateral heaps or bands.
