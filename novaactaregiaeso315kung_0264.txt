A year later FEWKEs 1> states with regard to the Glypeastroid
Echinarachnius that »with the first indication of an ingrowth of the ga-
strula stom-ach or archenteron⁷ we find budding off into the segmentation
cavity certain 00118)); to judge from his figures, these mesenchyme cells
arise from the entoderm.

In 1888 1311330182) explains that the mesenchyme takes its origin
in Comatula mediterranea from the archenteron and mainly from its
end⁷ and the same year FLEISCHMAN ³) states with regard to the Spatan-
goids, that the wandering cells issue from the vegetative pole of the
Blastula of Echinocardiunn cordatum. Lastly in the same year KoRsoHELT4)
makes known his views of this matter and asserts that the mesenohyme
origin-ates from the entoderm, either from the vegetative pole of the
Blastula (Echinoids, Ophiurids and the genus Oneum-aria), 01· from the
place which has just begun to invaginate (Holothuria), or from the end
of the invaginated archenteron (Asteroids, Crinoids and Synapta).

A quite different view was suggested, first by GREEFF5) with
regard to Asteriae rubens and afterwards by BERGH ⁶), who has studied
the first stages in the development of Echinus miliaris. Both agree in
the opinion that the mesenchyme arises not only from the entoderm but
also from the eotoderm, though Bergh adds that the greater number of
wandering cells issue from the former. In his splendid researches on the
development of Asterina gibbosa LUDWIG ⁷> comes to the general result,

not had the opportunity myself of seeing the original: »Ueber den Bau und die Ent-
wicklung der Echinodermen. Sechste Mittheilung—Sizungsber. d. Ges. z. Bef. di ges.

Entwicklung des Asteracanthion rubens vom Ei bis zur Bipinnaria und Brachiolaria»
printed in the sanie journal 1876, 110 evidently holds the contrary view, viz. that the
mesenchyme originates from the entoderm.
