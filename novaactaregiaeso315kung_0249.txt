ECHINOCYAMUS PUSILLUS. 13

slightly unequal; as to the edentate Echinoids FLEISCHMAN 1> points out
that they are of unequal size, but judging from the figures which he
gives the difference must even here be very inconspicuous if it exist at
all. Considering this, it appears credible that the very first stages of
the development as well as the whole process of segmentation, which
will be understood from the following7 are displayed in about the same
manner in the different groups of Echinoids.

Stadium with four εθφηθηΐὸ.

The changes which take place not only in the mutual position
of the two blastomeres but even in their externa] shape are rather re-
markable and⁷ as it seems to me, have not been sufficiently regarded.

At first the two segments, as seen from the side, are oval and
slightly flattened against each other, Pa. I, figy. 10.

“ Then they acquire a more spherical shape so that the area of
contact becomes very inconsiderable, Pl. I7 fly. II.

After this, they press gradually towards each other, with the
result that the area of contact becomes large and flat.

Finally the segmentation spheres almost assume the shape of
hemispheres, so much are they pressed and flattened against each other.
When the large flat areas are most closely united, the nucleus has be—
come most distinct and its contour well defined, Pl. I, fiy. 12.

Subsequently they begin again to separate, which process is in-
troduced by the nuclei ceasing to be visible‚ Pl. I, fiq. 13, and begin-
ning to repeat the well known important changes. As this separation
proceeds, each segment begins to present the two star-shaped figures
formed by radia] striae, Pl. I, fly. 14, which become very distinct when
the two segments have fully separated so as to present themselves as
two oval spheres placed side by side.

From the above mentioned changes7 which take place during
the transformation of the 2-cell stage into the 4-cell stage and which
in each subsequent division are to be repeated, it is evident not only
that the clear protoplasm surrounding the nucleus in each segment and
the nucleus itself are in restless activity during the processes of seg-
mentation, but also that the remaining part of the segments, which is
