‘Phe formation of calcarecus deposits.

The manner in which the calcal-eous deposits originate in the
Echinoderms‚ and the subsequent mode of increase of the skeleton are
by no means clear and offer a great deal of interest. When studying
these proeesses, the investigator soon perceives that the calciferous
cells⁷ though free in the blastocoel, act by no means without method⁷
and that they cooperate for a common goal as if they were consciens.
Moreover, the processes apparently remind us of those which go on
during the formation of bone and dentine in the vertebrated animals.
In the Echinoderms too we may with good reason speak of cells ho-
mclogous to the osteoblasts and ostoclasts, the calcareous substance ha-
ving been formed by the agency of the calciferous cells and absorbed
again in case of exigency by others or possibly by the same cells. Thus,
the formation and absorption of calcareous substance is effected by me-
senchyme cells of the same shape, as far as is known, which is not
the case in the formation and absorption of bone, the osteoblasts being
different in shape from the ostoclasts, — but this difference does not
seem to be of importance⁷ since it is supposed that the latter are de-
rived from the former. Resides, if we succeed in elucidating this pro—
cess in the Echffloderms, it will certainly throw light upon the way in
which the osteoblasts and odontoblasts take part in the ossification,
whether the peripheral part of them becomes directly converted into
osseous substance or whether the ground-substance of bone is formed
outside the cells in an intercellular substance.

It is a known fact that the larval as well as post-larval skeleton
characteristic of most Echinoderms is formed by the agency of the me-¹
senchyme cells. In Echfflocyamus, in which the formation of calcareous
deposits begins earlier than in most other Echinoderms‚ the first ente-
ring cells move to two fixed places in the Blastffla, arranging themselves
in two bilaterally symmetrical heaps or bands, one on the right and one
on the left side of the larva. It is a sight of the greatest interest to
follow these cells, to see how they move towards these two places as by
word of command in order to form there the two first centres of cal-
cificaticn. As far as 1 remember I have never seen the formation of
calcal-eous substance take place before these centres consist of at least
three cells which contain one or more minute crystals apparently of an
indefinite shape.
