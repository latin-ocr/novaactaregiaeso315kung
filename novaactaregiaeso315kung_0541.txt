ΟΝ ARSENICAL PARALYSIs. 15

The experiinents made by KREYser as well as JAEscflssssl) were
therefore principally of negative significance as regards the settling of
the niain question in dispute.

‹JAESCHKE had also proved the occurrence of hemorrhage in the
medulla. But. all these experiments were of course ofno use in deciding
the quest-ion as to the localization of arsenio paralysis.

Consequently the experiments vere resumed by ALEXANDER‘2), who.
in his poisoning experiments, found the same clinica] form of arsenio
paralysis as found in 111311; namely paralysis followed by muscular atrophy
aud disorders of sensibility also tenderness to pressure of the neural
trunks. ALEXANDER could now prove that the ganglion cells in the me-
dulla really had the peculiarities pointed out by POPOW‚ but agrees with
KREYssie in that respect that these had no pathological signification. Also
he found important. changes in the peripheral nerves‚ namely a colossal
increase to the normal conditions of degenerated spinal nerve fibres as
well both motor as sensory.

On the other hand the cranial nerves were unchanged. These
changes ALEXANDER looked upon as secondary to the capillary throm-
boses discovered by SILBERMANN as caused by arsenical poisoning.

Even the degeneratione of the muscles ALEXANDER regards as de-
pending upon nutritive disorders and not at. all as secondary results of
neural degeneration. ’

If nOW, by experimentS, the question as to the pathological ana-
tomical changes of arsenic intoxication of animals can he regarded 30
111 great part solved⁷ one cannot immediately apply the same to man.

The first published case of postmortem examination after arsenio
paralysis in man which I know in detail appeared this year (1892) in
foreign literature by the Russain Doctors ERLICKI and RYBALKm.

In their case the first symptoms of the effects on the nerves of
arsenio occurred on the 8ἰὴ day after the poisoning3 on the ΘΗ) and lom
weakness ensued in the lower extreinities and a few days later in the
arms as well. After about 2 months the patient died and on the post mor-
tem examination the following changes in the nervous system were noted.

No macroscopical changes in the medulla oblongata 01 spinal
cord. On the other hand the microscope showed a considerable dege-
neration of the nerve cells in the anterior cornua and central part of
the grey substance.
