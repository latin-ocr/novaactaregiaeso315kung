ECHINooYAMus Puslhnus. 57

sents a pentagona] outline with the angles in the direction of the in-
ten-adia, Pl. IX, fig). 109. The spinous teeth proti-ude through the oral
opening. In spite of repeated investigations, I have not succeeded in
detecting any anal aperture, wherefore I suppose that the posterior ex-
tremity of the alimentary canal still remains closed. The dorsa] region
is strengthened by a. large calcified perforated plate covering the greater
part of the back, Pl. IX, ιῙὶῃ. 107.

If we try to truce the origin of this dorsal plate, it appears, sin-
gularly enough, to arise in a way different from that in which the other
plates develop in the young sea-urchin. An examination of the figures,
Pl. VIII, fig). loo—104, shows clearly that it does not originate from
a new centre of calcification as is the case with the other plates, but
· that it grows out from the central part of the odd dorsal rod which
characterizes the fully mature Pluteus, fig). 100 0. As may be remem-
bered, this rod consists of two anterior arms and a shorter posterior one
which all meet and join in a centre situated close to the place where
the madreporic canai opens externally. From an inspection of the figures
it is clear that even in the pluteus stage the rods send off branches
which by degrees unite and protrude new branches, so as to produce
a network with large irregular meshes round the water-pore. The
plate thus formed gradually increases in size and during the process of
growth the primary rods become more and more constituents of the
plate. When the plate has attained such a size as to cover a good deal
of the dorsa] region, traces of the two anterior rods of the spicule still
remain distinguishable. Of course, I do not mean by this to deny that
some parts of the rods in question, especially their ends, have under-
gone resorption, which seems to be the case with most of the lai-val
skeleton. In order to understand the growth of the calcar-eous deposits
in general and all the changes which take place in connection with it,
we must note that a re-deposition of calcareous matters must occur side
by side with an absorption just as is the case during the formation and .
growth of bone, or in other words, While a part of the wandering cells
are employed in building up, other so-called phagocytes devour and
destroy such parts of the plates. rods etc„ which are useless or impede
the advance of a normal development.
