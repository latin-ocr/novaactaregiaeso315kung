front‚ fiy. 82—83 η. Thus⁷ the intestine lies pressed between the sto-
mach and the ventral wall of the larva.

In the full-sized Pluteus of this first stage even the ectoderm has
changed remarkably. In the Gastrula it consisted of a rather uniform
cylinder-epithelium except at the animal pole of the larva, where it at-
tained a considerable height. A few days afterwards, when the larva is
about three or four days old, the ectoderm has become very thin, except
at the ciliated band, and is made up of a simple layer os large poly-
gonal flattened cells with distinct nuclei. A section through the larval
body-wall shows that the cells resemble much flattened scales with a
slight dilation where the nucleus has its place⁷ Pl. IKfiy. 59—60.
Owing to the size of these cells and the fact that they each carry only a
single cilium, the cilia become rather sparse on the surface of the larva.
Scattered among the above polygonal cells, others are to be found
which present a round discoidal form, Pl. IV, finq. 58, and are marked
by a number of dots, which treated with nitrate of silver become very
well defined and when seen in profile appear as small knobs. By the
use of the same staining reagent we find that the surface also of the
polygonal cells appears finely punctuated. Is seems probable that this
punctuation is due to minute plasmatic processes shooting out from the
cells and that the larger dots or rather knobs in the rounded cells are
nothing but bundles of such processes, which surround the cilium. In-
deed, as I have already said, I have often observed that the cells are
provided With not only a large cilium but also with minute hair-like
processes which give the surface of the cells a finely fringed appearance.

The cells which constitute the ciliated band are remarkable. They
present themselves in the shape of a bottle bearing outwardly, besides
a cilium, a considerable border‚ Pl. IV, βιῳ. 61-63, and when examined
with the highest power, they curicusly remind one of collar-cells in the
Porifera. Each cell is produced at its free extremity into a long cilium,
round the base of which the clear ectoplasm of the cell protrudes like a
collar, which sometimes appears homogeneous‚ but osten on the other hand
is finely striated, as if it were composed of fine ectoplasmic processes.
All these minute projecting parts of the ectoplasm of the cells whether
they are scattered as in the polygonal flattened cells, or collected in¹
bundles as in thev discoidal cells, or united so asto form a collar⁷
offer great interest and have as far as I know escaped the attention
of other investigatorS. They possibly explain the way in which the
collar is formed in the true collar-cells in the Porifera. At first⁷ there
