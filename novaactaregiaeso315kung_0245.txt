ECHINOCYAMUS PUSILLUS. 9

a fully even contour, being at the same time more and more removed
from the yolk by means of the rapid increase of plasma, which is a
result of the strong vital activity in the yolk. The intermediate space,
which becomes filled up with homogeneous plasma, finally att-ains very
large dimensions, reaching a thickness of 0,02 mm, while the yolk itself
has a diameter of about O,088 mm. The membrane which defines this
space, is of course in its turn enveloped by the mucilaginous invest-
ment above mentioned. Probably the membrane, as it expands, increases
in firmness, thus preventing the entrance of any more spermatozoa.

As is well known, it is supposed that the homogeneous plasma
which surrounds the yolk, is due to a certain contractior] of the vitelline
plasma which effects simultaneously a delivery of plasmatio fluid. But
considering the great quantity of such fluid which would be delivered,
the volume of the yolk itself ought necessarily to be greatly diminished.
This is not the case however in Echinocyamus, or if it is so, it must
be in a very inconspicuous degree. If for instance the yolk before the
impregnation has a diameter of about Opes mm„ this dimension remains
almost the same, though a layer of plasmatic fluid measuring up to
0,02 mm. in thickness is formed round it. I cannot give any other
reason for this fact, than that a rapid increase of new-formed plasma
takes place, caused by the activity of the impregnated egg.

In normal eggs, when examining them with the highest power, I
have formed the impression that the yolk sends out very fine pseudopo-
dia-like processes through the plasma which fill up the intermediate space
between the yolk itself and the membrane. In other, probably abnor-
mal, eggs, Ι have seen, besides these fine processes, others of consi-
derable size and provided with plasmatio branches, sc that one gets a
view in almost all respects resembling that figured by SELENKA²) in his
description of the formation of the zona radiata. Though by no means
sure of it, I believe these latter eggs to be in some way imperfect, be-
cause they often during the course of their development shew morbid
’ symptoms, these large, branched pseudopodia-like processes being in my
opinion morbid. When studying the development of such eggs, Ι have
found that the surface of the yolk remains very uneven for a long
time and that often irregularities occur in the segmentation which lead
inevitably to the destruction of the embryo.
