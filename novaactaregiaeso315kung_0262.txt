Judging from the figures given by SELENKA, a differentiation of the cells
at the animal pole exists in some forms, especially in Echinocardiutn
cordatum, while there is no trace of such a differentiation in other forms⁷
as for instance in Strongylocentrotus lividus etc. In Dorocidaris pa-
pillata¹) the larva in this state of the development is oval with a tuft
of long cilia at the animal pole. In Strongylocentrotus dr'obachiensis
the Grastrula also acquires an oval shape‚ according to AGAsSIz 2), and
the cells at its animal pole seem to be considerably higher.

On the whole, the present literature shows that the Grastrulae in
most Echinoids are spherica] or slightly oval and that they never or only
exceptionally reach the length which characterizes the Gastrula of Echi-
nocyamus. Concerning the thickened area at the apical pole, there is
scarcely any information available, but the figures drawn by the investi-
gators show that such an area is present in several forms. As far as
I knOW‚ only NACHTRIEB has clearly pointed out the presence of this
»sensory» disk in some Echinoids.

For-mation of the Mesenchyme.

Considering that several different opinions have been promulgated
as to the origin of the mesenchyme in the Echinoderms and that the
point still remains undecided, I paid special attention to it, and the
more so as the question has gained a certain interest. I may first be
allowed to give a short account of these different views.

HENSEN ³) was the first to observe in the larva of a starfish, that
the mesenchyme cells, which were met with in the segmentation cavity‚
took their origin from the vegetative pole of the larva or rather from
that part which was in a state of invagination and that they gradually
lost their connection with the other cells. In the year 1869 this state-
