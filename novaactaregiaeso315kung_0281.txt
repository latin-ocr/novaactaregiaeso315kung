ECHINOOYAMUS PUSILLUS. 45

of calcification, the fifth in order, which gives rise, in a similar way to
that above mentioned, to a three-armed spicule, Pl. VII, fig). 92—96,
the posterior arm of which remains short, while the two anterior ones
pass on each side of the oral area and enter two anterior dorsal arms,
which begin to protrude close by the anterior ventral arms, Pl. VI,
fi9. 87 cl.

Thus, the mature Pluteus possesses eight arms and five centres
of calcification, Pl. VI, fl9. 90. lt measures, including the arms which
gradually attain a considerable length, about O,72 mm. During the in-
crease of the young sea urchin, the Pluteus itself gradually changes
in its external shape. Its posterior portion, hitherto more or less
elongate, becomes more *rounded or even slightly broader than long,
and the angles between the posterior arms have by degrees travelled
backwards and are to be found nearer to the posterior end of the body.
Meanwhile, the¹ ciliated band and the larval tegument in its vicinity in-
crease in such a degree as to cause the origin of a number of auricular
lobes, which shoot out from the body and grow slightly backwards, evi-
dently on purpose to facilitate the process of sWimming and the loco-
motion of the young sea-urchin. In this manner the Pluteus finally
acquires three pairs of such ear-like lobes, Pl. VI, fi9. 90 e, s, 9.

Inasmuch as the larval arms are capable of being stretched out
fron] the body, which process in its turn forces the auricular lobes to
extend in an almost horizontal direction, it is manifest that this arran-
gement assists lnovement in! the water in a high degree and acts in a
similar manner to the contractile swimming disc in the Coelenterata.

But also the foremost part of the larva has undergone some
changes, a small »preorab lobe having been formed in front of the
ciliated band and between the anterior arms.

As far as my experiences go, the development from the mature
Pluteus to the young sea-urchin takes a period of about six weeks, while
the changes from the egg to the mature Pluteus pass very rapidly or
in a fortnight. At least this is what has happened in my aquaria.

A search into the rich literature which concerns the development
of the Echinoderms, shows that Ι. Mummi alone has described larvae os
Echinocyamus in different stages, dredged by means of a tow-net from
the surface of the sea. His drawiugs of larvae obtained at Triest, Nice,
Elsinore and Heligoland evidently prove that he investigated young spe-
cimens of the Olypeastroid in question. In the first accounts in which
larvae of Echinocyamus are treated, Ι. Mamm was in unoertainty as to
