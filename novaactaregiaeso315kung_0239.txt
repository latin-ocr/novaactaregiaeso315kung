ECHINOOYAMUS PUSILLUS. 3

Ι.
Methods.

Considering how difficult it is to bring the larvae of Echinoids
from artificially fertilized eggs into conditions older than the Pluteus
stage, as may be understood from the numerous experiments of other
investigators‚ who have never succeeded in bringing them to full ma-
turity, I think it may be useful to explain somewhat fully the methods
by means of which Ι managed to get larvae developed in the aquaria
through all the different stages of metamorphosis from the egg to the
young sea-urchin.

During my first summer stay at ‘she Swedish biological marine
station I never succeeded in bringing larvae of Echinocyamus to any
advanced stage of development. The oldest larvae Ι obtained in the
aquaria that summer were Phinei, but, as they were mostly in want of the
final pair of arms and calcareous spicules⁷ even these had not reached
a stage of full Pluteus maturity. In consequence of this no other choice
was left me than to attempt to collect the older stages by means of
MULLER’S tow-net from the surface of the sea. During the breeding
experiments Ι usually kept the larvae in tanks of glass of a capacity of
4 to 5 liters and containing either sea-water alone or sea-water with some
green marine plants; in the former case the larvae were almost'devoid
of pigment, and in both cases they did not live beyond six weeks. Ι
also placed basius and cylinders of glass in ice⁷ in order to imitate the
coolness at the bottom of the sea⁷ but even these experiments were
without result3 the development of the larvae was only delayed, so thar
the Blastula stage for instance, which at an ordinary room temperature
is reached during the course of the first day, in this case was not arrived
at till after two or three days.

Finally I took large glass cylinders of a capacity of 15 or 20
liters⁷ in which were placed a great number of larvae and fertilized eggs⁷
and let them drift about on the surface of the sea in an almost vertical
position with the wide opening very carefully closed with an extremely
fine-meshed canvas. By the movement of the sea currents and change
of water were effected‚ but this experiment was also unsuccessful.

On account of the great inxportance for a successful study of the
embryology of Echinoderms and other invertebrates of obtaining complete
