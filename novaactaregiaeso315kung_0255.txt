cited he speaks of a considerable difference in size between the seg-
mentation spheres in the fourth stadium of oleavage and some years
later FLE1SCHMAN ¹) states the same with regard to Echinocardium cor-
datum. Thus, it may be a rule among all the Echinoids, that a real
difference in the size of the segmentation spheres first occurs in the
fourth cleavage stadium 2).

'Phe Blastula stage.

Shortly after the end of the seventh or eighth hour after the fecun-
dation has taken place, the blastomeres have arranged themselves so
as to form a spherica] Blastula or Blastosphere‚ Pl. II, fig). 31. In other
cases this stage of the development is accomplished more or less rapidly
according as the temperature is higher or lower. There is no solid
morula stage. The young Blastula reaches a diameter of about 0‚1 mm,
and its segmentation cavity, which is filled up with a clear homoge-
neous substance, measures about O‚06 mm. This homogeneous substance,
HENSEN’s ))Gallertkern))‚ is apparently a product of the activity of the
blastomeres from the time when the first trace of a segmentation cavity
becomes visible, and is probably, at least until the blastula stage is
reached, of the same plasmatical nature as the homogeneous plasma
which at the moment of fertilization arises round the yolk and removes
the vitelline membrane. As has been mentioned above, this plasma also
is the result of the activity of the undivided egg-cell at the moment
of fertilization.

(The cells which constitute the Blastoderm‚ have lost their round
shape from mutual compression and obtained a slightly cylindrical form:
viewed from the surface, each cell has a polygonal outline, While in

2) According to BROOKS — Handbook of invertebrate Zoology, Boston 1882—
all the segments in Arbacia punctulata seem to be equal, as may be also understood
from his figureS‚ drawn by GARMAN. Unfortunately, Ι have not been able to see the
original »Notes» on Arbacia punctulata by COLTON and GARMAN. Further investiga-
tions will prove whether BROOKS is right in his statements.
