6 HJALMAR THEEL,

the stages in which they are figured on the last plates of this report,
towards the end of August. q

As to the small »humid chambers», which are to be placed on
the microscope-stage, and which have long been in use for the pur-
pose of studying the different phases in the development of the eggs,I
availed myself of two kinds, one with the water-drop hanging down
from the under surface of the cover-glass, the other with the water-drop
slightly pressed between the object-glass and the cover-glass. Of these
two kinds of microscope-aquaria I prefer the latter, because the water-
drop does not shake or tremble so much, for which reason one need
not sear tha't the egg living in it will get disturbed so easily. To pre-
vent the compression of the eggS, it is as well to place between the
glasses some small particles of wax, and in order to hinder the evapo-
ration of the water, to tighten and fix the cover-glass with melted pa—
raffine or wax. In such chambers I have succeeded in following the
gradual changes in the development of the same egg for several days,
from the impregnation to the first Pluteus stage. Meanwhile the micro-
scope-aquaria should be kept in a moderate temperature.

Lastly, Ι may refer in a few words to my practica] acquaintance
with the process of fertilization of the eggs of Echinocyamus. There
is no difficulty at all in artificially fertilizing eggs of this animal, but
in order to be successful it seems to be of a certain importance to

choose anim-als accustomed to live under almost the same conditions. -

The specimens of Echinocyamus which I generally used for my experi-
ments, lived at a depth of a few fathoms on a clay bottom close to
Fiskebackskil, a sea-side place at the west-coast of Sweden. The tem-
perature of the water is during the summer-time rather high and the
clay at the bottom is mixed with the refuse animal and vegetable matter
from the kitchen of the Baths Restaurant, which possibly explains the fact
that the Echinocyamus occurs there in very great numbers, while it is much
rarer in cleaner and colder water. If I placed the eggs of a female
individual, taken from this locality, in the male fiuid from another indi-
vidual dredged in the open sea from a greater depth, where the water
is much cleaner and colder, my experiments were unsuccessful and the
larvae were abnormal. If this proves to be a rule, and not a mere acci-
dent, it is probably due to the different modes of life of the two indivi-
duals in question, which result in such a remarkable differentiation that
the normal evolution becomes impossible. However, the experiments
ought to be repeated, in order to throw light upon this matter.
