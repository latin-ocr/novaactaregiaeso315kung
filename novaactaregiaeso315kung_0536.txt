10 S. E. Hsusormu,

The nerve bundles and fibres in the grey substance are otherwise⁷
with the exception of those in the immediate neighbourhoud of the cavity⁷
well preserved and normal and as numerous in the left as in the right half.

The left lateral pyramid colii1n1rlying nearest the cyste correspon-
ding with the greatest size of the cavity is partly degenerated, whilst
the right one is not.

Cui 2-3 cen. above tlte point of tlze cauda.

Already on a section 3 cm. above the cauda all signs of destruc-
tion in the left grey substance cease3 the cornua show their normal con-
figuration on both sides, the ganglion cells in general have no processes
but have sharp outlines and distinct nuclei. Otherwise there is no di-
stinct degeneration in the white substance.

The periplzeral merces. For the exainination of the peripheralner-
ves unfortunately the peripheral parts as well as inuscles were missing,
not having been preserved by the pathologist who made the post-mortem
examination. I have thus been entirely confined to the pieces of spinal
nerves which were removed with cord as well as cauda equina. The
following nerves were examined: 5²¹¹ cervical nerve, 8¹¹¹ cervical nerve
and 3Υᾶ sacra] nerve. The following changes were ‘there met with.

In tlte 5⁰¹ cervical nerve the most nerve-bundles are degenerated;
only few nerves are normal and well coloured.

1η tlte 8¹¹² cervicalnerve the changes varied in different bundles.
In some the nerve sheaths of several nerve-fibres were well stained;
amongst such normal nerves, however others imperfectly coloured were
mixed, and some of the nerve fibres remained almost colourless. These
differences were best seen in the longitudinal sections.

In tlte 3”‘¹ sacral nerve the condition was also different in different
bundles. In some thicker nerve bundles some fibres were intensively
coloured in others only certain bundles⁷ whilst others were in advan-
ced degenemffiou, finally in some all the fibres were totally colom-less.

Gener-al conclusions.

Etioloyy.

There is no doubt that in the above described case intoxication
-was really caused by arsenio. The whole illness corresponds so minutely
with that of similar published cases ‘of poisoning, that it is almost im—
possible to doubt the etiology, moi-eover the symptoms do not correspond
