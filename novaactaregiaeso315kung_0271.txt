EcmNOCYAMUs Pnsmws. 35

In Echinocyamus the deposit which is originated by the agency
of these cells, takes at first the form of a tetrahedron measuring up to
0‚004 mm, while the cells themselves have a diameter of O,01 mm.⁷ Pl. JV.
fiy. 74—75. 8111111οΝ1) was the first to explain the tetrahedron as the
primordial form of the deposits in other Echinoderms. The minute
tetrahedron grows rapidly to a small star with three very short arms.
Pl. IV, ...βίᾳ 69, acquiring a shape almost completely corresponding to
the inter-space between three close-lying calciferous cells. Thus one is
almost tempted to think that there exist-s a certain relation between the
form of the deposit and the interspace in question. The calciferous cells
having placed themselves close to the ectoderrn, the deposit becomes
pressed between them and the latter, Pl. [V7 fiy. 77. If it be 60, that
this interspace decides the outline of the star, one would expect always
to find it in its early developmental stage placed just between the
calciferous cells. This seems. however, rarely 10 be the case. Mostly I
have noticed the sta-r situated by the interspace with the arms upon the
three cells, Pl. IV, fi‘q. 69—70‚ and not between them, and sometimesl
have seen the star itself somewhat displaced, Pl. IV, βψ 78. Not-
withstanding this, I cannot free myself from the thought that the cells
mechanically exercise influence on the outline of the tetrahedron and the
star in the earliest stages of the development.

Before Ι go further in the description of my own investigations,
I may be allowed 10 state in a few words the two views which have
been suggested with regard to the origin of the calcareous deposits in
the' Echinoderms ²).

SELENKA 3)7 who first ventured to treat this question, shows that
in the interior of two bilaterally symmetrical cells a minute calca-
reous body becomes deposited, that this grows into a regular three-
armed figure, and that the cell itself moves towards one of the arms,
still persists in depositing calcareous salts (and organic substances) and

2) Besides these two views Some others have been suggested with regard
to the origin of the calcareous deposits in the Holothurioidea, but as they are not
founded on embryological investigations I only refer to them: SEMPER (Holothurien
