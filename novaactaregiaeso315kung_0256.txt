:20 HJALMAR THEEL,

profile a row of such cells looks like a low palisade, the sides of each
being flattened where they touch; the outer end of the cells is slightly
convex, while the inner is more sharply and irregularly cui-ved, thus
making the inner sursace of the blastoderm rather uneven. Seeing
that the cells arc not by any means regular in shape, some being
shorter, broader and evidently in a state of division and multiplication,
as may be seen from the different stages of karyokinesis, this 1111017011-
11088 becomes very conspicuous. The chromatio filaments or chromosomes
in those cells which are in 3 81310 of division, appear very clearly if
the whole larva be stained with Grubler's acetic acid carmine. It is not
yet possible to distinguish any thickened area in the blastoderm.

Socn the Blastosphere begins to rotate, first feebly and 111011 more
rapidly, by means of the plasmatio hair-like processes or cilia, which
protrude, 103011 3 considerable length and move more 01 1088 rapidly
111 the intermediate space between 1110 larva and the vitelline mem-
brane, Pl. ΙΙ, fig). 36. Sometimes I have found that the mucilaginous
coat which surrounds the vitelline membrane of the egg, still remains
enveloping the whole. However, the larva now in a 811011 time escapes
from the enveloping coats of the egg into the water and begins to swim
about, Pl. II, fiy. 33—35.

Simultaneously an obvious differentiation begins to take place in
the cells at the vegetative pole, which increase in length and become
higher and columnar, 111080 31 1110 opposite pole on the contrary 81111
remaining for 3 811011 111110 unchanged. Resides the cilia, the outward
ends of the 00118 of the blastoderm possess extremely minute, closely
crowded plasmatic processes, Pl. III, ιἡρ. 51, which treated with osmic acid
present themselves distinctly. I never saw anything similar 10 11118 before.

After 11118 1110 Β13811113 begins to extend in length and increase
in such 3 degree, 11131 31 3130111 twelve or thirteen honrs after the fecun-
dation it reaches a length of O,15 mm. and 3 breadth of 0,09 mm. In
many places the cells are in a state of division, presenting the charac—
teristic chromatio filaments in different positions.

Gradually the Blastula changes its external shape, so that it al-
most assumes a cylindrical form and reaches an unusual length. The
largest I have observed, Pl. II, fiy. 35, which were about twenty hours
old and fully mature, had a length of O,2 mm. and a breadth of O,11 mm.;
other larvae, in which the first indication of an invagination at the vege-
1311170 pole was making its appearance, measured O,23 mm. in length, but

only 0,044 mm. in 1310311111, Pl. ΙΙ, fiy. 34.
