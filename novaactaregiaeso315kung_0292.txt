a small dilatation, fig). 112. Subsequently the end of the tooth grows
more powerful and commences to give off spines more or less ob-
tuse, which, when the tooth has reached such a length that it becomes
visible through the just opened mouth, which happens at about sixty
days after the fecundation7 Pl. IX, fig). 109, appear not only on the
lateral sides, but on 1110 cutting edge, where they grow large and
blunt. This is a fact of interest⁷ since in the fully mature Echiuocya-
mus the teeth are devoid of spines. As to the carina⁷ there are scarcely
yet any traces of it to be detected.

The question whether the teeth originate by the agency of cells
folded in from the epithelium or from migratory cells7 may at present
be left undecided. However⁷ I believe that the buccal membrane cannot
partake in this process7 and on the whole I was never able to observe ⁷
any kind of invagination of ectoderm or entoderm. GIESBRECHT¹) has
in an excellent manner described the structure of the teeth in the sea-
urchins and I hope in the future, when I have succeeded in raising
older stages of Echinocyamus or of other sea-urchins, 10 be able to
confirm his statements7 the specimens hitherto at my disposal having
been too young. “

After ‘this short sketch of the metamorphosis of the sea—urchin‚ Ι
may perhaps describe in a few words the oldest young one I have raised
in my aquaria, which reached an age of about two months, Pl. IX, fi9.
107. It has assumed an oval form⁷ and its dorsal surface is convex
while the lower one is almost plane. The measurements are as follows:

Length of the body without spines . . . . 0,4 mm.
Breadth of the body » 2 . . . . oste mm.
Length of the pointed spines ...... Οςῑ mm.
Length of the two posterior pointed spines . 0‚3 mm.
Length of the truncated spines ...... Ο,11 mm.

If We glance at the figure, the bilateral arrangement must
appear very striking. Not only do the spines in general seem to be
symmetrical in position, but especially 1110 two long posterior spines
contribute 10 give the animal a bilaterally symmetrical aspect. Besides⁷
considering the smallness of the spines in the adult animal, it. must be
surprising 10 find them in 1110 young attain such a length. The buccal
membrane has just become pierced. and the mouth thus produced pre-
