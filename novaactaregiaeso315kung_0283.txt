papillata, which he believes to be abnormal. However7 at present we
may take it for granted, that the unpaired rod characterizes the larvae
of the Spatangoids. With regard to the Clypeastroids‚ they appear to
have the Pluteus more rounded posteriorly, to be devoid of epaulettes
and the terminal arm⁷ and to be in possession of but eight arms.

‘Phe development of the young sea-urchin.

The changes which take place in the larvae of the Echinoids
during the metamorphosis are indeed of the highest interest, and⁷ con-
sidering the incompleteness of our present knowledge, they certainly
deserve a careful reexamination. Notwithstanding this, Ι am compelled
for several reasons to treat the chapter in question in a very summary
manner. Firsfly, I could not obtain larvae in an advanced state before
the beginning of August⁷ and on the first of September I was obliged to
resume my teaching at the University of Upsala, and consequently there
was not time enough at my disposal to bring my studies to the desi-
red end. Moreover from want of time I have been unable to prosecute
my researches at Upsala. Lastly⁷ in order to present a true account of
the young sea-urchins at my disposal, I am greatly in need of specimens
in somewhat older conditions. More than once therefore Ι have found
myself inclined to put off the publishing of this chapter till the future,
but being in uncertainty as to the time when Ι may get the chance of
renewing my studies on the development of Echinocyamus, I have de-
* cided to send forth my researches even in their incompleteness. Thus⁷
the following pages only pretend to be considered as a> preliminary ac-
count o'r rather as an explanation of the plates.

As has been previously noticed⁷ the vaso-peritoneal vesicle becomes
constricted off from the archenteron in a very early stage of the deve-
lopment and becomes rapidly separated into two vesicles, which arrange
themselves on each side of the oesophagus. The constriction of the ar-
chenteron and the separation of the vesicles seem to pass almost simul—
taneously. In a short time ‘they are also spread backwards over a part
