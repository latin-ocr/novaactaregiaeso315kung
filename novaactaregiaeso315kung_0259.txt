area. we almost entirely lack the information necessary for forming a
correct opinion. As far as our present knowledge goes, only the Bla-
stula of Echinus microtuberculatus seems to be provided with a thickened
apical area. ‚

Though the information which we possess concerning the Bla-
stula stage of Spatangoids is incomplete⁷ we find that according to
SELENKA ¹) and FLfflsoHMAN 2> the larva of Echinoeardium cordatum pre-
sents an almost spherical or slightly oval shape and is devoid of any
obvious apical area of differentiated cells.

The incompleteness of our present knowledge prevents a closer
comparison, but judging from what is known we are entitled to con-
sider the elongate, cylindrical Blastula of Echinocyamus as rather in-
teresting and singular of its kind. Another peculiarity characterizing
the larva in question is the early formation of calcareous spicules, Pl.
II, figy. 35, which, as far as Ι have been able to discover from the litera-
ture at my disposal, never takes place in the Blastula of other Echi-
noids, except in a Subsequent stadium. Probably the same is the case
with the differentiated cell-area at the animal pole, which presents itself
in this very early stage of the development of Echinocyamus; because,
to judge fron] literature as well as from what Ι have seen mysels
during my studies at the sea⁷ such a polar differentiation takes place in
many forms of Echinoid larvae but not till the gastrula stage. This
is confirmed by NACHTROEB 3), who has found that this is the case
not only in Mellita‚ but even in Strongylocentrotus and the Spatangoid
Moira atropos.

The differentiated cell—area at the animal pole with its tuft of long
cilia probably serves as a larval organ of sense and therefore claims a
certain interest.
