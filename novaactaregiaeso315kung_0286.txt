remains of‘the pluteus skeleton. BesideS‚ sea-urchins with such re-
mains are by no means rarely met with in the open sea. In the year
1846 Mi'JLLER ¹) gave some figures of a sea-urchin with larval remains
and recently FEWKns 2) has figured a young Echinarachnius bearing long
rods on the dors-al surface. Considering that these rem-ains are in
want of a cellular investment and that on the whole only scattered
fragments of tissues are left on them, Pl. VIII, fiff- 102, it seems
not possible that they can be absorbed by the wandering cells or
phagocytes as evidently is the case with the greater part of the lar—
val skeleton. They probably are simply broken and thrown off from
the body.

After this short survey of the changes which take place during
the growth of the young sea-urchin within the Pluteus⁷ I may be allowed
to describe the stages of young Echinocyamus which I have succeeded
in raising in my aquaria.

The very young sea-urchin, which has just lost most of the
larval appendages but still retains some calcareous rods protruding from
the dorsal surface, presents itself as a minute sphere or oval with the
feet, spines and spherids encircling it in such a manner as to form a
ring or boundary between the greater dorsa] region and the small ventral
one⁷ Pl. VIII, fiq.101—-102. The young one is now about forty-five days
old and has a diameter of about O‚24 mm. It wants oral as wellas anal
openings. A closer examination of it offers a good deal of interest.
The ventral space, Pa. VIII, fiy. 106, in the centre of which the mouth
eventually breaks open in older stages, is smooth‚pigmented and pre-
sents a more or less obviously pentagona] form. It has become inclo-
sed with a ring of fifteen delicate perforated plates, which gradually
began to appear in the earlier stages, when the sea-urchin was still
retained within the Pluteus. The arrangement of these plates in the
young Echinocyamus agrees remarkably well with that in young spe-
cimens of Abatus cavernosus, described and figured by LovnN ³) in his
beautiful work „on Pourtalesia. Here as well as there, the ambulacra are
indicated by five pairs of calcified plates and the interambulacra by five
