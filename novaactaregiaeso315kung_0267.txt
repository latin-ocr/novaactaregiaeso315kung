EcnmocrAMus PUSILLUS. 31

vegetative pole increase in number in such a degree that they often
give the impression of being arranged in several layers. Those in the
inner layers, which either have lost their connection so as to be free
or still remain attached to the wall of the Blastula by plasmatio fila-
ments, enter the blastocoel irregularly and accumulate at first close to
the vegetative pole. As may be understood froin my figures, some of
these cells have evidently obtained a club-shaped appearance by having
been pushed into the blastocoel without losing their connection with the
point of attachment. These cells are in process of separation as future
wandering cells. As a rule, several such cells enter the blastocoel simul-
taneously. Thus I never succeeded in finding any arche-mesenchyme
cells in the Blastula of Echinocyamus.

In spite of repeated immersions of the objects in different colou-
ring fluids, Ι very rarely found the cells at the vegetative pole in a
state of division. Only a few times did Ι succeed in observing cells
there in different stages of karyokinesis after having stained the objects
with GRUBLER'S acetic aeid carmine, while it is easy to get splendid
views of cells in division in other places of the blastoderm. If it is
true that cells in a state of division are rarely met with at the vege-
tative pole, the cells which are detached ought to be subsequently re-
placed by others in some way, and we may well suppose that the wan-
dering cells have been pushed into the blastocoel by the pressure effected
by the remaining blastonieres being in a lively state of division and
multiplicatiori.

In connection herewith it ought to be mentioned that I have only
in very few cases seen the free mesenchyme cells in the Blastula in a
state of division, and therefore suppose that they increase in number
during the blastula stage mainly by means of inimigration and that it is
only in subsequent developmental stages of the larva that a multipli-
cation by division takes place.

I never found that the wandering cells issue from any other
place in the blastoderm than⁴ the vegetative pole.

Thus from what I have said above the mesenchyme cells do not
enter the blastocoel in any definite order in Eehinocyamus⁷ but soon after,
at 15 to 20 hours after the fecundation, they arrange themselves in two
bilaterally symmetrical heaps or hands, one along each side of the Bla-
stula‚ Pl. Π, fig). 33—35. It seems to be a. rule that most of the cells
which have first become free, take this symmetrical position and⁷ besides7
that they differ from the cells entering later in having a more rounded
