form and in possessing smaller pseudopodia, which are sometimes totally
withdrawn. These cells are true calciferous cells, and constitute the
matrix of the future spieules, thus corresponding 10 1116 osteoblasts in
the vertebrated animals.

However‚ it ought to be kept in mind that not all cells which
first become free, are calciferous cells, because Ι have often, though not
always, seen cells detached, which were provided with large and long
pseudopodia and were evidently destined to perform different functione.
In the blastula stage these cells are by no means so prevalent, but in
a subsequent development-al stage they increase considerably in number.
Thus a very early differentiation appears to take place in the mesen-
chyme cells.

The two heaps of calciferous cells 60011 become combined by a
tranverse bridge of cells crossing the ventral surface of the Blastula,
Pl. II⁷ fiqq. 34—35 and Pl. III, flq. 37, and at about 20 or 25 hours
after the fecundation a very minute calcareous deposit is to be found
at the middle of each heap of cells. When the cells are ready to de-
posit calcareous matters⁷ they contain a multitude of granules of varying
size and brigffiuess, among which one or more calca-renus crystals are
present, thus rendering the nucleus visible only with difficulty. During
the formation of calcareous substance, Pl. Ι V, fiy. 76, the 06116 have chan-
ged considerably and vary in size‚ some being highly elongate, measuring
up to 0.,036 111111, others remaining smaller, having a diameter of only
0⁷012 10 Ο,ο16 mm.

The other cells of the mesenehyme, which have 10 perform dif-
ferent functions, have an irregular shape, fine granules and a distinct
nucleus. By degrees during the immigration they protrude finer and
coarser pseudopodia‚ which sometimes anastomose with the pseudopodia
of other cells, thus giving rise to a kind of network with wide meshes,
Pl. l V, fiy. ὅθ’-68. Ι have often seen these amoeboid cells arrange them-
selves in such a manner as to constitute an intercommunication between
the ectoderm and the invaginating entoderm. It is common 10 1111(1 111
young Gastrulae such cells attached by one pseudopodium to the ectoderm
and by another to the archenteron, which is just in a state of growth‚ thus
giving one the impression that they facilitate the process of invagination.

As I have mentioned above, the cells in question begin the im-
migration during the blastula stage though spaffingly, and it is of interest
10 11016 that they are continuously separating and entering the blastocoel
during the whole gastrulation. When examining sections of Gastrulae in
