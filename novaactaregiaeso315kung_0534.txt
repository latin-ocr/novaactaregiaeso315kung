Section ¹⁸²s'7 1883.

Dura rather dark-red from fine injected vessels, inner surface
smooth and glistening. The pia likevvise hyperaemic. Subarachnoid
fluid plenteous. The ventricles of the brain distended by a clear fiuid
of more than normal quantity. Brain substance tolerably firm, shows
hyperaemia in white as well as grey substance.

The membranes of the spinal cord that show nothing abnormal
more than that their vessels are filled with blood.

The consi'stency of the spinal cord is diminished. In the cervical
cord the delineation of the grey substance is indistinct ancl the white sub-
stance is swollen. Delineation becomes more distinct in the dorsal part.
In the left anterior half of the lumbar medulla there is in the grey
substance a cavitgs Which measures in the length about 1--2 cm and
about 1 cm. transversely. Above and below as well as on the sides of
this cavity the substance of the spinal cord is grey-red in colour and
very loose.

On making a transversal section nothing was obser-ved to run out
of this cavity.

The white substance in the medulla is on an average looser than
normal, sostest, almost soppy, in the cervical and lumbar cord.

Miorosoopioal Examination.

Spinal cord.

Of this about 80 transverse sections were cut from the cervical
marrow, cervical swelling, lower part of the dorsal marrow7 loin swelling
and the caudalpart. Coloured in Weigert's hematoxyline‚ carmine and

Cervical M arrow.

No macroscopical changes vvere to be seen with the exception that
the Goll⁷s columns were degenerated.

The φεμ substance had preserved its form and the cornua were
similar on both sides. The anterior as well as the posterior cornua
and commissure had numerous well-coloured and there fore normal nerve-
bundles and single> nerve-fibreS.

lee cells in the anterior horn appear to be scanty. There are all
transitions between fairly large and almost normal cells with well defined
nuclei and sharp outlines and distinct but not numerous processes and
completely atrophied cells, these latter are numerous. They ary very ,
