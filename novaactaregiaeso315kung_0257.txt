In 6 full-sized Blastula, the cells not only at the vegetative pole,
11111 even 111086 61 the animal pole attain a greater length and acquire
an almost column-ar form. The cilia at both the opposite poles are
very large.

The formation of the mesenehyme, which will be treated more
fully in a following chapter, has taken place in the larva at a rather
early period. When the larva 1168 reached an age of about fifteen hours,
Pl. II, fiy. 36, cells at the vegetative pole lose their connection with
the surrounding cells and wander as amoeboid cells into the blastocoel.
Presently we find that these wandering cells have arranged themselves
into two bilateral heaps, one on each side of the 1316811116, Pa. H, fisJ.
33—35, and that at about twenty hours after the fecundation, 611 extremely
small calcareous body arises, originated by the heaps of cells. Thus,
the 0610616008 spicules begin to develop during the Blastula stage.

Special attention ought to bc paid to the differentiation of the
blastonieres, because it is obvious that we now have to do with three
different kinds of cells, those at the animal pole7 those at the vegetative
pole and the rest of the blastomeres, and that they serve to perform
different functione. Thus the cylindrical cells provided with very long
01116, which may be found forming 6 8111611 circular thickened area at
the animal pole of the Β16811116, remind one obviously of the apical
disk with its tuft of cilia common in larvae of Annelids and other everte—
brates. One is almost tempted to believe that they are larval sensory
cells and that their long cilia have nothing to do with the locomotion.

NACHTR1EB¹) also has called our attention to a similar arrange—
ment in the larva of 1116 Clypeastroid Mellita. He says: »At the pole
opposite to where the blastopore is formed is a small circular area in
which the 01116 are longer, stronger⁷ and less active than those at any
other point of the larva. When the (168111116- 18 swirnming these long
01116 are directed forwards, now and then sway to and fro slightly, but
never aid in propelling or turning the larva, apparently being inactive
except that occasionally they seem to act as sensory cilia». This quite
agrees with what I have found in Echinocyamus. On the contrary
FEWKEs2) did not pay any special attention 10 this apical area in the
larva of Echinarachnius.
