series of larvae up to the young animal, I repeated my experiments du-
ring the summer of 1891, and with satisfactory results. I will here de—
scribe somewhat fully the method which enabled nie to succeed and the
precautions which should be followed, as they will, Ι hope, prove to the
advantage of other investigators.

1> The aquaria ought to be large and rather high, of a capacity of
30 liters or more3 the most suitable are those made altogether
of glass. They must be covered in.

2) A sufficient number of marine plants, especially Enteromorpha
intestinalis and E. compressa, grown upon small stones, must be
placed in the aquaria. They supply the water with air, and as
soon as they have lost their air· and gas-sacs‚ they must of course
be exchanged for new plants. Before putting the plants in the
aquaria, it is of great importance to clean them and wash them
carefully, thus preventing the mass of minute aninials such as
Mollusca, Entornostracans etc, which are attached to and living
on them, from filling up the aquarium and fouling its water.

3> Several times a day the water must be cautiously stirred with a
glass—rod, so as to cause a current and prevent the formation of
the film on the surface which is well known to characterize stag-
nant Water. It is evident that this thin membraneus film has
a pernicious influence 011 the larvae, hindering them from reaching
the surface itself· and preventing the water froin coming into
immediate contact with the air. Besides, the film is a favorite
resort of a good many miorosoopio animals such as Infusoria,
minute Entomostracans eto„ which rapidly multiply, foul the water
and nourish themselves at the expense of the larvae. If the water
be kept in motion, the larvae do not so easily fall a prey to
their enemies.

4) All the water used must be fetched from the open sea, and not
from the shore, and it is quite necessary to let it pass through
a filter made of a piece of eloth or the finest canvas.

5) Moreover, it is of importance every other day to let a part of
the water at the hottom of the aquarium flow away, which is
easily done by means of a fine glass-siphon. While the water is
flowing away, it is advisable to change the position of the siphon
in such a manner that as much as possible of the foul matter
which lias sunk to the bottom may be removed. If this foul
matter is not. talzen away, the enemies of the larvae increase very
