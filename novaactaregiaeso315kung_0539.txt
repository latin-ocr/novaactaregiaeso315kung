ΟΝ AnsunioAL PARALYsls. 13

Severe emaciation of the lnuscleS, fore-arms and hands as well
as lower-legs had ensued.

Bladder and rectum shewed no functional disorders. The whole
of this nosography so fully coincides with that of the polyneuritis and
general syinptom complex of arsenic poisoning that it scarcely requires
any comments. I may⁷ however add that the pains remained about 3
months after intoxication which is not generally the case with acute
polyneuritis but as above mentionedthis is a characteristic of arsenical
paralysis. Also it is worthy of notice that the paralysis on the patients
entry in to the hospital was already regressing. Paralysis in the arms had
been so severe that the patient could not guide food to the mouth but
cn examination at the hospital she could seed herself although she had
not yet regained such strength in the hands asto be able to cut her food.

Again the paralysis in the lower extremities remained so that the
patient must¹ still keep her bed. Even in this respect the case was cha-
racteristlc.

lee Nature ancl LocaCizatz'on of Arsenic Paralysis.

Up to the last few years we have lived in ignorance as to the
anatoniical nature and localization of arsenical paralysis

The cause of this is what I have already mentioned viz: the ab·
sence of post mortem examinatior] in all cases.

Prior writers accepted the fact, without satisfactory proofs that the
cause of arsenic paralysis must be searched for in the spinal cord
and even ΕΗΒ declares in his celebrated work published in 1876 that the
symptoms of certain intoxications, as⁷ amongst others, arsenical paralysis,
indicate a spinal disease.

In the meantime this opinion during the next few years did not
remain undisputed. In the same degree as we learned to recognize the
real localization and symptoms of neuritis and polyneuritis it was con-
sidered that arsenio paralysis must also here be included.

¹ Such an opinion was first expressed by LEYDEN and this as early
as 18753 and since then his suggestion has been supported by several
authors such as JAEsCHKE and STRfiMPELL.

Seeing that it was impossible to decide the question by post-
mortem section as to the anatomical localization and nature of arsenical
paralysis, experiments on animal were resorted to.

To effect this two different methods were adopted. Some obser-
vers analysed chemically the brain, spinal cord and muscles with the
