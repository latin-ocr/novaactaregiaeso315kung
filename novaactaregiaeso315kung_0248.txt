at the sanie time the clear plasma is transported to the poles of the
nucleus, thus giving rise to a figure resembling a pestle Pl. I, fly. 6—7.
After this, the polar stars become very distinct, Pl I⁷ fiy. 8, each occu-
pying a half of the yolk. Now the metamorphosis of the nucleus enters
on a new phase3 the nucleus totally passes out of vieW‚ the two aecu-
mulations of clear plasma, which constitute the centre of each star,
gradually lose their connection, and the radii of the stars extend in all
directions round each clear plasma.

At 40 or 50 minutes after the impregnation the radii of the stars
become most obvious and now the moment of cleavage is present, Pl.
I, fig). 9‘10, the yolk beginning immediately to divide into two equal
segments or spheres, the act of segmentation having been induced
by a slight constriction or furrow at the animal pole of the ovum.
The first cleavage. plane is a vertical one. As soon as the two
segments have become separated from each other, the protoplasmic
radia-tion into them disappears. The new nucleus in each segment
remains indistinct for some momente⁷ but shortly presente itself as a
well defined round body.

According to FEWKES 1> the two first segmentis in Echinarachnius
are also of equal size, and with regard to Mellita NAGHTR1E32) says:
»the first two planes of segmentation (meridional) and the third, which
is equatorial, divides the egg into eight blastomeres of equal size —-
occasionally the four at one pole are a trifle larger than the four at
the opposite pole».

If we consider the phenomena of the first segmentation in the
dentigerous regular Echinoids and the edentate ones, it will be seen
that in the former, according to SELENKA³)‚ PRonHo4) and others the
first spheres of segmentation are equa-l in all respects or but very
