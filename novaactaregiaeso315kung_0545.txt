ΟΝ ARsENICAL PARLYs1s. 19

The circumstances point to the conclusion that the hemorrhage
in the cord in this case was similar in nature to those found in experi-
ments on animals where the changes in the spinal cord take place a
few houres after intoxication. Thus we see that arsenio affects the cord
and probably simultaneously with it the peripheral nerves1). Porow's
case of arsenio intoxication where extravasation of blood as well as a
few changes in the ganglion cells were found also confirms this view.

My case then presents the following instructive facts:

1) It is a case of paralysis from arsenio where the symptoms
have developed themselves in an exceptionally typica] and sudden manner.

2) Contrary to the rule this case has caused death.

3) On post mortem examination a little column of extravasated
blood was found in the left half of the grey substance at the level of
the 2¹¹d lumbar nerve.

4) This hemorrhage ought not to have produced the paralysis.

5) It has not caused disorders either of the bladder or rectum.

6) Nor been followed by other distinct symptoms.

7) Nor caused any distinct change in the conveyance of pain.

8) On the other hand the paralysis could satisfactorily be explained
by the widely spread polyneuritis.

9) Paralysis was incomplete and almost transitory in the arms
but permanent in the legs.

. 10) Also the large spinal gaglion cells werejdistinctly degenerated

, and many in high degree atrophic.

11) Arsenic thus produces in man olzanqes both in the medulla and
peripheral marves and apparently simultaneously because

12> the rapid appearance of the sensory symptoms speaks against
the possibility that- the neuritis is secondary3 and the hemorrhage in
the medulla shows that this is primarily affected by arsenio.
