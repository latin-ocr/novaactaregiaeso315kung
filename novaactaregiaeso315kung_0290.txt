of the star, which prcceeding appears 10 take place in a somewhat different
manner. In the meantime, the rods themselves unite with their conver-
ging points and gradually swell towards the top, so that finally the
spherid as seen from above presents itself as three globes closely
united and with a minute hole in the middle. This stage, which mea-
sures about 0701ss 111111. in length and 0⁷024f' mm. in breadth, is the oldest
I have had at my disposal. According to Lovrssm 1> the mature spherids in
Echinocyamus have a height of 0,09 mm. and a breadth of Ο,11 mm.
Considering this fact, it is clear that the calcareous cover-ing, in which
the spherid is concealed⁷ ought to change from time 10 time in size⁷
but this evidently cannot take place without a resorption followed by a
new formation.

Almost at the same time as the spherids begin to originate⁷ the
first indication of the dentary apparatus appears. A careful examination
of the ventral region shows that inside the bucca] membrane in each
interradium three minute calcareous deposits become visible long before
1116 mouth opens externally⁷ Pl. VIII, flfl· 105—106. Of these deposits
the middle one in each interradium early assumes a singular shape and
structuzffe being designed for a tooth, fiq. 106 t. Shortly after the
appearance of the deposits above mentioned, three other calcareous spi-
cules of minute size gradually become visible in each 'radium inside the
buccal membrane⁷ but somewhat deeper than the prim-ary deposits⁷ fl9.
105. Altogether then, the Aristotle⁷s lantern is built up from thirty
centres of calcification‚ fifteen radia] and as many interradiaL five of
which develop into teeth. The twenty-five spicules 111-156 in the same way
as the peristomal plates and grow into as many irregular pieces of a
meshy tissue, Which coalesce or join so as to constitute the alveoli⁷
which form a kind of socket in which the teeth are set. The manner
in which the changes of the different spicules take place 111 01·(161 to
raise the lantern will be understood from the figures, Pl. IX, fiq.
108-109. The adjacent surfaces of the alveoli become united by
strong transverse muscular fibres. While 1116 alveoli are made up of
a calcareous network, the meshes of which are unequal and in certain
places almost disappear 011 account of the vigorous increase ¹of the
bars inclosing them, the teeth themselves present a structure quite
different. When first distinguishable⁷ they have the form of a 1111-
111116 almost equilateral triangle with one angle towards the centre of
the bucca] membrane and the opposite base placed lowe1 when the
