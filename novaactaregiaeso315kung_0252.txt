are formed, irregularities in segmentation begin, but as I did not pay
special attention to segmentation l shall not attempt a description of
the process».

Stadium with siseteen segmenta

This stage is accomplished at about two hours and 20 minutes
after the fecundation. First the four upper segments are divided by a
horizontal plane into four small cells or micromeres and four ))large>)
ones. Immediately after this segmentation or, though more seldom, be-
fore it is accomplished, the four lower segments are divided by a ver-
tica] plane into eight almost equal spheres, which become arranged in
a more or less irregular manner in two rows. Sometimes it is diffi-
cult to decide whether they are placed in one or two rows, Pl. ΙΙ, fig.
25—26.

Thus we find in this stage of development three different sizes
of segmentation spheres: at the upper pole four very small micromeres,
under these four ))large» macromeres and at the lower pole eight some-
What »smallern macromeres arranged in two more or less distinct rows.
Thus⁷ the segmentation is now unequal. In order to prevent misunder-
standing Ι prefer to use in the following the terms: micromeres, »large»
macromeres and »smallem niacromeres.

Stadium with thirty-two seyments.

Shortly after the preceding process of segmentation has been
finished, or at two hours and about 35 minutes after the fewndation,
the >)large>) macromeres begin to be divided by vertical planes into
eight equa] spheres arranged in a rOW. The next division concerns the
»smalh lower macromeres, each of them being parted by horizontal
planes into two equal segments, so as to present themselves in two
rows one above the other, eight in each. Lastly, 15 or 20 minutes
after the division of the »large» macromeres, the four micromeres at
the animal pole become parted by horizontal planes into eig11t‚fou1·
of which are smaller⁷ contain a clearer protoplasm and, as they lie in
the same plane, constitute the animal pole itself3 the four remaining
ones have their place somewhat outside and belom Pl. II, fly. 27-29.

In some cases I have observed that the »smalh macromeres be-
gin this stage of segmentation⁷ but this seems not to be a rule. As
ought to be understood from the above, the segmentation spheres pre-
sent themselves in four different sizes.
