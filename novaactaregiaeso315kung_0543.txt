ΟΝ ARssnicAL PARALYsis. 17

Even the left pyramidal track was in a certain part in the length
of a few cm ch ¹mged where the hemon-hage lay at the lirnit of the grey
substance besides the named path.

Also a ascending deqeneoation of the Golls columns was found I
have said above that in the spinal cord of aninials poisoned by arsenio
microscopical or small macroscopical hemorrhages were discovered in
the grey substance.

Some inquirers appear to have taken no notice of these whilst
others have decidedly affirmed that they were constantly present. In
ERLICKI'S sand RYBALmN's case there was an injection found in the larger-
ve'ssels. It is under these circumstances interesting to find that in my
case this hyperaemia has developed to hemorrhage. Such spinal apo-
plexies or lzematomyelz‘a of [as one might term it in this case] primary
kind are extremely rai-ely met with, if we except trauinatic cases. It
is true that LEV1ER1) had collected 16 cases of hematomyelia and HAYEM2)
34, but the latter carnes on a critical examin-atlon of these to the con·
clusion that at that time (1872) no primary case was to be found pu-
blished in literature. However EioHHoRsr 3) as well as LEYDEN 4) prove
that real priniary medullar hemorrhages were to be found and LEYDEN
has even grouped them with regard to the etiology into hemorrhages
namely due to 1) arteriosclerosis, 2) traumata, 3) diminished pressure of
air (divers etc.)⁷ 4> spontaneous⁷ [which hemorrhages arise from physi-
cal exertion or suppressed menstruation]. My case cannot be classed
in any of these groups, therefore it clearly forms example of a fifth
variety where hemorrhage is caused by intoxication. In this way this
case is not unique as similar hemorrhages in arsenio poisoning of ani-
mals are often met With and in one case of arsenio poisoning in man
<Popow)5). The hemon-hage in this case has, as in the arsenio experi-
ments, appeared in ‘the grey substance and is so called column-formed
as in Lssvfflss’s and LEYDsn's case, if also only ofinconsiderable extension.

According to LEYDEN the hemorrhage of the cord is characterised
by pain. This seems to have been absent in my case3 probably owing
to the slight extension of the hemorrhage and its restrictiori to the an-
