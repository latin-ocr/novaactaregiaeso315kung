rich in deutoplasm‚ does not remain passive. On the contrary, we have
seen that the segments have gradually undergone important changes not
only in their mutual position but even in their external form. When
studying the phenomena of segmentation one get-s the impression that
the segments alternately attract and repel each other, and that the
highest degree of attraction occurs when the nuclei after a completed
segmentation have obtained their rounded distinct form and are in a
state of repose.

In all the eggs of Echiuocyamus, of which Ι have studied the
segmentation⁷ I always found the above phenomena repeated with re-
markable constancy not only during the first divisions but during the
whole cleavage process.

The phenomena, which have been discussed above⁷ are by no
means peculiar to the Echinocyamus‚ but are without doubt the rule
in the segmentation of other eggs. Thus, O. HERTw1G1) mentions some-
thing similar in Toxopneustes lividus (LAMK) and evidently SELENKA ²)
has observed the same in several other Echinoderms. With regard to
other types of invertebrate animals, Lovfm³> as early as in 1848 de-
scribes certain phenomena in the segmentation of the eggs of Mo-
diolaria marmorata Fomz, which must doubtlessly be referred to the
same, and MARK 4) points out that similar changes of the external form
and position of the segmentation spheres take place in Limax cam-
pestris ΒΙΝΝΕΥ.

At about one hour and 20 minutes after the fecundation the
second segmentation stage is accomplished by means of a second ver-
tical plane5 forming right angles with the first cleavage plane. Here
also the constriction begins with a furrow at- the ani-mal pole of the
egg⁷ Pl. I, fiy. 15. We have now four perfectly equal cells, which
seen from above are almost round, Pl. I, fiq. 16, but from the side
