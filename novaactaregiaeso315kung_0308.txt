Plate IV.

Fig. 58. A portion of the eotoderm taken from the right side of a Pluteus in its first stage,

showing ‘awo different kinds of cells. The calcal-eous deposit of the right, side appears
through the ectoderm. Treated with nitrate of silver.
59. Section of the ectoderm of a Pluteos six days old⁴ Hardened in osmic aeid.
60. Optieal section of the eotoderm, drawn from a living specimen six days old.
61. Section of the eotodermic cells of the ciliated band. Hardened in oemio aoid and stained
with haematoxylin. ·
62, Side view of an arm of a young Pluteus to show the relation in eize between the large
flat eotodermio cells and the cylindrical bottle-shaped ones of the ciliated band. Treated
with nitrate of silver.
63. The same cells as those drawn in figure 61, though under a higher power.
64. Section of the body-wall of a Blastula.
65. Portions of the two deposits of one side of the mature Pluteus.
66—68. Mesenchyme cells of a pluteus, abou‘o fifty hours old. Treated with osmic aeid.
69. Oalciferous cells which have deposited a minute star, drawn from a living Blastula. Dia-
meter of the cells: O‚01—-O‚009 mm. Size of the star: 0.004 mm. Upper view.
70. The same in a somewhat older Blastula.
71—73. Pigment cells lying close inside the eetoderm; drawn from a living Pluteus.
74—75. Genti-es of ealeification with the tetrahedron in situ. Hardened in a very diluted so-
lution of osmie aeid. In fig. 75 the tetrahedrou is sui-founded by a lump of plasm.
76. Calciferous cells varying in size from O‚012 mm.‚ to Ome mm. Treated with osmic aeid.
77. Optical seotion of the body-wall of a Blastula showing the three-armet} star situated be-
tween the blastoderm and the caloiferous cells. Drawn from a living specimen.
78—80. Three developmental stages of a ealoareous spic-,ule showing the relation between the
deposit itself and the calciferous cells. 'treated with a very diluted solution of
osmic aeid.
81. Optical seccion of the body-wall at the centre of ealcification showing the common pseu-
dopodial plasm of the calciferous cells running close inside the Blastoderm. A very
minute deposit has just begun to arise. Hardened in a diluted solution of osmic aeid.
