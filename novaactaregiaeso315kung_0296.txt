Flete I.

The mature ovum in its mucilaginous coat at the moment ot impregnation. One sperma-
tozoon is euteriug the yolk and the vitelline membrane is just beginning to separate.
Diameter of the egg including its coat: 0,1e mm.

The same ovum slightly later. The vitelline membrane has separated and the egg shows
very fine radiating pseudopodia.

The same ovum at about 10 minutes after the fecundation. The male and female pro-
nuelei have fused to form the first segmentation mustene, round which the clear plasm
shows a radiate arrangement. The vitellus is surrounded by a thiu layer of homoge-
neous plasm, which is omitted in most of the figuresy as is the ease also with the mu-
eilaginous coat.

The same ovum somexvhat older. The nucleus has begun to change into a spindle and
traces of a ‚radiate arrangement of the plasm are still seen at its poles.

The same ovum slightly later. The spindle is complete and a plasmatio radiation at each
pole becomes discernible.

The same ovum at about 30 minutes after the fecundation. The spindie and the radia-
tions begin to disappear.

The same ovum slightly later. showing the pestle-shaped figure.

The same ovum somewhat older. The polar radiatious have begun again to appear.

The same ovum at about 40 minutes after the fecundation. The first division has began.

The sanie ovum slightly later. The two segments are separated, oval and slightly flattened
against each other. The radiations remain distinct.

. The same ovum slightly later. The segments have changed into spheres. The radiations

have disappeared.
The same ovum slightly later. The segments have changed into hemispheres and become
pressed against each other. The nuclei are well defined. A radiation is traoeable.
The same ovum slightly later. The segments have begun to separate again. The nuclei
are indistinet and the radiation has disappeared again.

The same ovum slightly later. The segments have separated. are oval again aud show
the pestles.

The same ovum at about one hour and 10 minutes after the feoundation.

The same ovum 5—10 minutes later. The second segmentatiou stage is accomplished, four
equal segments having separated. Seen from above.

The sanie ovum slightly later. The segments begin to press against each other.

The same ovum slightly later.

The same ovum slightly later. The segments are closely pressed against each other.
Seen from above.

A sperma‘tozoon. Length: Ome mm.
