If we examine the Blastula stage of other Echinoids, we see
clearly that they deviate considerably in external shape from that known
in Echinocyamus. Thus, according to NACH'PRIEB¹) and FEWKEs ²) the Bla-
stula in Mellita and Echinarachnius is more or less distinctly spherical.
According to SELENKA 3) the Blastulae of Echinus miliaris, Toxopneustes
brevispinosus⁷ Strongylocentrotus lividus and Arbacia pustulosa have,
at least to judge from the figures of the author⁷ an almost spherica] shape
and are apparently devoid of any cell-differentiation at the animal pole.
In a more recent work the same investigator 4) gives an account of the
segmentation phenomena in Strongylocentrotus lividus, Sphaerechinus gra-
nularis and Echinus microtuberculatus3 here also one arrives at the fact
that the Blastula is spherical or slightly oval and furthermore that in
the last mentioned form a differentiated cell—area is present at the ani-
mal pole. In the explanation of the plates SELENKA names this area
»Scheitelzonfflm According to A. AGAssmf’) the Blastula of Strongylocen-
trotus clrobaehiensis is spherical and. as far as I can see7 devoid of
any cell-differentiation at the animal pole. PROUHo 6) describes the Bla-
stula of Dorocidaris papillata as spherical and provided With longer cilia
at the animal pole, but judging from his figure the cells themselves are
not extended in length. Finally according to DEBRE'JS 7) the Blastula of
Echinus esculentus also becomes spherical. but he does not say any-
thing about the animal pole.

The above cited authors lead one necessarily to the opinion
that the Blastula in the regular Echinoids presents itself as a rule in a
spherical or slightly oval shape. With regard to the differentiation of
the cells at the animal pole, and the formation of a thickened apical
