it ought to be pointed out that in slightly older specimens the radial
plates seem 10 have united so as to form a single plate in each 01111111-
lacrum. At 10001, Ι 110νο 1101 110011 able to discern more than one in the
three anterior ambulacra, viz. the frontal and the adjacent one on each
side of it, while 111 1110 two posterior there still remain some indications
of 'the previous state with double plates, Pl. IX‚fiy. 108. The changing
of the originally double plates into simple ones evidently takesplace 111
connection with the formation of the hollow chambers or outgrowths
of reticular tissue in which the spherids become concealed. According
10 my 1710117, 110111 of the two radial plates take part in these outgrowths
and become joined during this operation. As the spherids of the three
anterior ambulacra arise first, and subsequently those of the two poste-
rior, their calcified covering must originate in the same order, 001100-
quently we have an explanation why the two plates of the posterior 0111-
bulacra have not as get had time to coalesce in the specimen above
mentioned.

In the year 1855 MULLER¹) described and figur-ed some young
Echinoderms which he supposed to be larvae and young of Echinocya-
111110, but he did not pay attention either to the spherids or to the fact
that the radial plates were originally paired; on the whole, his figure of
the young sea-urchin does not seem 10 110 very accurate.

If we now return to the description of the young Echinocyamus⁷ 11
may be remarked that the five primary pedicels, Pl. VIII, ι119. 106, which
we have already seen originate in the Pluteus, 010 distributed one in
each ambulacrum. Resides, other pedicels successively protrude in the
neighbourhood of ‘the former though on the dorsal side of the boundary.
They are all devoid of supporting rods and terminal plates and their
tops present themselves as globular oval knobs slightly tapering to-
wards the end.

Immediately after the first calcareous deposits of the future in-
terradial plates have become traceable, the spines which rest on the
tubercles of the plates and articulate with them, take their origin. Of
course the plates and the spines standing on their tubercles arise from
two different centres of calcification‚ Pl. VII, ι1111. 92-95, The first
indication of both consists in an extremely small triangular body or rather
tetrahedron originated by the agency of mesenchyme 00110, Pl. VH, figy.
