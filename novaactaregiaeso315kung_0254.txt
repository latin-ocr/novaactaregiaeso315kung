1) That the preparation of the egg for the first segmentation requires
the longest time, and that in general the rapidity of segmenta-
tion is proportional to the size of the segments3 thus the latest
segmentation stages take the shortest time.

2> That at the first three cleavages the blastomeres are separated
almost simultaneously, but that afterwards a certain irregularity
occursf some sets of segments dividing earlier, others later.

3) That the blastorneres of each of the three first segmentation
stages are almost equal, but that they afterwards become di-
stinctly unequal.

4) That the difference in size is most evident in the fourth stage
of segmentation, when three quite different sizes are to be di-
stinguished.

If we turn to the writers by whom the phenomena of segmen-
tation in the Echinoids have been carefully treated, we shall find that
a great conformity in this respect prevails in the three different orders
of Echinoids. Greatest attention has been paid, it is true, to the in-
ternal phenomena of segmentation, to the metamorphosis of the nucleus
etc, but notwithstanding there are a few accounts which treat the mu—
tual relation between the segmentation spheres and give support to the
supposition which Ι have mentioned above. Thus, for instance, SELENKA1)
explains excellently the segmentation phenomena in Strongylocentrotus
lividus, Sphaerechinus granularis and Echinus microtuberculatus. [n all
these forms the blastomeres are equ-al in each of the three first seg-
mentation stages, but unequal in the fourth stage, where three different
sizes, micromeres, »largen macromeres and »small» macromeres, are to
be found. However, some years before the same investigator 2> says
in connection with his researches on Echinus miliaris, Toxopneustes
brevispinosus, Strongylocentrotus lividus, Arbacia pustulosa and Echino-
cardium cordatum: »wie bei anderen Echinodermen, so werden auch bei
den Echiniden sehr bald Grossendifferenzen zwischen den einzelnen Fur-
chungszellen wahrnehmbar, sobald namlich die Zahl derselben iiber 16
oder 32 hinausgeht». Unfortunately, Selenka does not in this report
give any figures of the segmentation stages. However, in the paper first
