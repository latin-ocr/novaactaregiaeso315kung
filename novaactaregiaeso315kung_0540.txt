intention of finding out where the arsenio appears in largest percentage
after poisoning, others made a microscopical examinatior] of these parts.
Tho first method must already a priori be acknowledged as rather
untrustworthy since no proof was forthcoming that the parts of the nerve
system retaining the greatest percentage of arsenio were also most af-
fected. This way was however accepted by Soonozomssow1>who‘came to
the result that a greater'percentage of arsenio was found in the brain
and spinal oord than in the muscles and consequently drew the conclu-
sion that arsenio paralysis depends upon changes in the spinal cord since
no clinioal symptoms show that the brain is the seat of the disease.

This inference however can still less be regarded'as correct be-
cause other inquirere such as LUleG etc. on anfflyzing, carne to a con—
trary conclusion, namely that the muscles contain comparatively more
arsenio than the centra] nervous system.

More important were the pathological anatomical experimental
investigations. VULPIAN‘Z) was on account of an examinatior] of the spinal
cord of an arsenio poisoned rabbit inclined to localize arsenio paralysis
to the spinal cord but considered his conclusions uncertain because of
the il] preserved condition of the latter. “

Through his poisoning experiments on dogs Popow3> came to the
identical result that paralysis depends upon acute diffuse myelitis. He
found besides changes in the vessels, hemon-hage in the grey substance,
certain changes in the cells, the protoplasnn of the latter being clouded5
cell body munded, nucleus scarcely noticeable, and the prooesses shorter
than normal. Besides these in the cells pigmentation and formation of
vaouoles were found. More over⁷ even in the white substance changes
appeared such as thickening of the axis cylinders: on the other hand
POPOW could not verify the changes in the peripheral nerves.

In the meanwhile KREYsSIG4> came with his experiments (which
were intended to control PoPow’s investigations)7 to the conclusions that
those changes distinguished by Popow were either artificial or could be
found under normal oonditions. Also KREYssie found hemorrhages in
the spinal cord, although only microscopical in size.
