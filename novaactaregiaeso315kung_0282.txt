their position. Thus, in the year 1852¹) he explains that they ought
not to be referred to the Olypeastroids i. e. Echinoeyamus. Here he
says: »Es bleibt daher noch ein Problem, die Art oder die Arten ffir
die Seeigellarven mit gegitterten Kalkstaben zu bestimmen». However‚
in the year 1855 ²) he expresses his decided opinion that these larvae
must. probably belong to Echinocyarnus.

As I have mentioned above, our present knowledge of the deve-
lopment of the Clypeastroids is very defective and⁷ if we except the papers
of Ι. Mummi, is confined to an account of the development of Echi-
narachnius3) and a very sragmentary sketch on Mellita4). It is of spe-
cial interest to note that the Pluteus of Echinarachnius bears such a
resemblance to that of Echinocyamus, that it seems almost impossible to
distinguish the one from the other. Judging from the description given
by FEWKEs the only difference may be »the existence of large pigment
spots near the distal ends» of the larval arms in Echinarachnius, Which
are not present in Echinocyamus.

Considering that, in spite of the rich literature, only comparati-
vely few pluteus-larvae are known so well as to make it possible to
refer them to fixed species of seamrchins, it is of course not possible
to draw comparisons between them in order to gain any general results
of value.

It has hitherto been a common idea that the Pluteus of the regular
Echinoids is provided with ciliated epaulettes which are absent in the Cly-
peastroids and Spatangoids. However, so far as is known, this appears to
be accurate only with regard to a limited number of the sub-order Echi-
nidae. On the other hand the Spatangoids are supposed to be distin-
guished by possessing an unpaired rod at the lower end. Though this
seems to be a rule in the irregular edentated Echinoids‚ it does not
exclude the possibility of such a rod being found in other larvae. Thus,
for instance, PROUHO ⁵) speaks of a terminal rod in a larva of Dorocidaris
