Amongst the remaining ganglion cells none were quite norma13
they were rounded ancl had lost most of their processes7 were more or
less diminished, some in a high (legree3 the contents of the cells were
inore or less transformed to a granular yellow or yellowish brown mass
and the cell nuclei were also changed or had disappeared. In the proto-
plasm leucocytes and vacuoles were sometimes met with, and vacuoles;
these latter writers regard as a sure sign of a pathological change. Fi-
nally the larger vessels were strongly injected.

An extensive and distinct degeneration of nerve fibres was found
in nervi radiales and peronei, which was of varying degree in different
parts. Normal as well regenerated fibres were met with by the side of
fully degenerated.

If we now compare the above mentioned changes with those I
found in my case the agreement is stricking.

Unfortunately I had not access tho the more peripheral nerves
but the examinatior] of the nerve roots was sufficiently exact and convin-
cing. Part of the nerve fibres were quite normal. Their medullary sheaths
being well coloured With VVeigert's hematoxyline others were in a condi-
tion of more or less well-marked degeneration.

In several, such as for instance the sacral nerves, no distinct co-
louring of the marrow sheaths of the nerve fibres could be perceived.
In the medulla analogous circumstances were found with those of the
Russian Doctors' case. The ganglion cells were reduced in number and
most of those remaining were changed. They were more or less dimi-
nished in size3 in the greater number no process was left3 many were
reduced to small rounded masses with granular contents. (Fig. 4.) In
the periphery or other part of the cell-substance‚-some were unusually
translucent, a change which corresponds to the partial change of the
protoplasm which ERLICKI and RYBALKIN speak of in their 0666.

These small atrophic cells sometimes showed no signe of nuclei.

But there was also an interesting and unusual change namely a
lzemorrlmye in the lumbar cord. This was only seen 111 the grey substance
of the left horn which through hemorrhage had become drawn out and
deformed and pressed to the periphery of the spinal cord. The hemorr-
hage measured about 1 0111. 111 height and 1 mm. in transseotion. The
fibres around the hemorrhage were partly destroyed and the ganglion
cells in the neighbourhood had evidently suffered from the presence of
the extravasated blood.
