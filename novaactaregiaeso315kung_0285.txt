¹and gradually takes the shape of a fine membrane, Pl. VII, fist 92.
This different-iation of the cells in the sac is easily traced from the
beginning of the invagination. So far as I have been able to see, the
opening of the invagination becomes subsequently closed, Which accor-
ding to METSCHNJKOFF also takes place in the Spatangoids. Ι may say
however that I have thought I have observed in some advanced larvae
an exterior opening still remaining, Pl. VII, fig). 95. The thick-walled
bottom of the disc-like sac plays an important part in the development
of the young sea-urchin, while the rest of the sac only serves as a kind
Ι of amnion.

When the disc is in contact with or not far fron] the hydrocoel.
the latter sends out into the former five tubular processes or rather
- feet, which thus have two different origins, the outer investment from
‘the ectoderni, i. e.. the thick-walled part of the invaginated sac, and
the inner from the mesoderm, i. e. the hydrocoel, Pl. VII, fly- 92—96.
The feet arrange themselves round the periphery, leaving a centra] space
of the disc free, which gradually assumes a pentagonal form and be-
comes the buccal disc of the outgrowing sea-urchin. The buceal mem-
brane remains for a time entire and unpierced. Now also the first traces
of calcareous plates⁷ spines and sphaeridia make their appearance, still
enclosed by the inenibraneous amnion. They arise in the following
order. First the five interradial laminae begin to calcify and immedia-
tely after the beginning of this process their spines begin to originate
from their own centres of calcification. Then five pairs of smaller
radial calcareous plates come to vieW‚ one pair in each interstice be-
tween the primary plates. Shortly afterwards one or seldoni two small
singular bodies appear to arise on the upper side of some of the radial
laminae, which are probably sphaeridia, and almost simultaneously the
first indicatione of the dentary apparatus become traceable, Pl. ΗΠ
ἡ9. 106. Of course, during its growth the young sea- urchin has broken
through the amnion and the larval epiderniis‚ so as to set the spines
and feet at liberty. Simultaneously the skeleton of the Pluteus has
been gradually undergoing atrophy and becomes so much absorbed that
only a few rods more or less destroyed are left, when the young sea-
urchin has passed the stage of Pluteus in order to settle at the bottom
of the sea, Pl. VIII, siff. loo—102.

In the youngest stages of sea-urchin which either swam in the
water or crawled about on the bottom of the aquaria, Ι have very of-

ten, if not always, found rods protruding fron] the body, which are
