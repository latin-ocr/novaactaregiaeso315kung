animal is examined from the ventral surface, the young teeth thus acqui-
ring an oblique position. Moreover, the tooth does not form a plane
triangle⁷ its upper or rather inwardly directed surface being concave‚
the opposite convex‚ Pl. IX, fig). III a—d. If we subject the convex
surface to a careful investigat-ion we see clearly that a keel runs fuoni
the top to the middle of the base and that another low ridge passes
along the base and close to it, crossing the keeLfiy. c—d. This being
so, I a1n much inclined to believe that also the teeth origin-ate as small
tetrahedrons. During the increase the tooth gradually assumes the shape
of an elongate isosceles triangle with the long sides curved inwardly.
In contrast to the alveoli, plates etc.⁷ which are composed of a calcareous
net-work with unequal and irregular meshes, the tooth in this condition
presente itself as a thin imperforate lamina of great transparency.
Already in a very early state, when the deposit reaches a size
of only O‚oos inm„ two new very minute triangular laminae appear placed
side by side fiat the base of the first lamina and on its inner concave
surface, ιῙῖιιγ. 111, b—c. The sides of these triangles are unequal‚ but
in such a way that they form together an equilaterally triangular
lamina, their adjacent sides being subsequently overlapped and during
growth more and more united. The coalescence begins with the angles7
which are directed towards the top of the future tooth, and extends
by degrees backwards‚ the bases still remaining separate for some time.
The lamina, arising in the way just sketched, arranges itself close to
the inside of the primary lamina, assumes the same curvation and in-
creases forwards as well as backwards, so that the paired base ex-
tends further back than that of the primary lamina. Successively new
laniinae arise inside the former and increase in the same way, the result
being that the tooth gradually elongates and gets thicker. At the same
time as this is⁴ going on, the long sides of the triangular laminae be-
come more and more-berit towards each other, so that they finally meet
and partly join with their anterior parts. Owing to this, each lamina
almost acquires the shape of a hollow cone7 and the whole tooth pre-
sents itself as a series of cones pushed one into the other, Pl. IX, fiq.
112. During this developmental process, the increasing tooth becomes
slightly arcuate in the direction of its length. Seeing that new laininae
incessantly arise at the base, the tooth is necessarily forced to protmde,
so that its top gradually advances to the centre of the bucca] membrane,
which still remains unpierced. Such a tooth of a sea-urchin fifty days
old has a length Of 0‚os mm. and a breadth of O‚024 nnn, and its top
