40 HJALMAR THEEL,

10 be traced by the fact that the cells, where the baud develops, present
themselves columnar in profile and, when viewed from the surface, some-
what smaller and polygonal from mutual compression. Of course, those
cells still remain highest, which originally belonged to the animal pole
of the Gastrula but have directly passed into the ciliated band.

In the meantime, great changes have taken place with regard to
the shape of the body. The dorsal surface has been highly convexed‚
which is also the case with the under part of the ventral, while the
rest of that surface has become strongly concave. Thus⁷ two areas are

13 bounded by the ciliated band. The whole animal gradually assumes
the shape of a bell turned upside down, which becomes more conspi-
cuous in somewhat older larvae. The cells at‘the original vegetative
pole have passed into 1116 6111οᾶ6111116 sack during the invagination⁷ and
the blastopore itself 1163 gradually changed place in front 011 the convex
part of the ventral surface, and consequently the posterior end of 1116
Pluteus in 110 163116613 corresponds to the vegetative pole of the
Gastrula.

In the meantime the first formed pair of calcareous 31613 have
increased and changed considerably, their three processes or rather
rods having lengthened obviously and obtained spines or small bran-
ches. One of the rods⁷ Pl. V, fiq. 82—85 c, runs on 1116 66111161
surface of the larva towards its middle-line, crossing the corresponding
rod of ¹the opposite. star just at the transverse portion of the ciliated
band. Often they not only 01033 but also coalesce. The second rod,
Pl. V, ι119. 82—85 b7 passes along the ventral surface towards the poste-
rior end of the larva7 and the third runs towards the dorsal surface, Pl.
V⁷ ‘Ji-q. 83 f, and divides into two, of which one branch, Pl. V, fiy.
82—·85 e, extends forwa-rds towards the anterior lobe of the larva in
order to support subsequently the anterior venti-al arms, while the other
passes towards the posterior end of the larva and there obtains 001131-
derable branches⁷ which meet those from the posterior ventral rod, Pl.
V, fiy. 82—85 d. However., the arrangement of these latter branches
is subject to variations of more or less 11111101161166, which may be best
understood from the figures. Lastly we have to pay attention to the
latticed rods, which support the posterior ventral arms of the larva,
Pl. V, fig). 82—85 α. Α3 before mentioned, they begin to arise du-
ring the gastrula stage, as three small processes, one on each rod·of
the star close to its centre, Pl. III, fiy. 38. These processes stretch in
