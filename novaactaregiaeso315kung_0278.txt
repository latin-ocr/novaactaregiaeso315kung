42 HJALMAR Tum,

Now the blind end of the archenteron commences to undergo a
series of remarkable changes. It assumes at first a rounded expanded
appearance, Pl. HI, fiy. 43, after which it flattens, becomes depressed
against the rest of the archenteron, fiy. 47, and presents itself as a disc,
fig). 48, which grows larger, while its peripheral part bends towards the
archenteron, fiy. 49. Simultaneously it becomes gradually separated by
constrictior] fiy. 44 c, so as to form a vaso—peritoneal vesicle, which takes
a dorsal position and at the same time divides into two vesicles, which
arrange themselves on the right and left sides of the oesophagus, fiy.
45 e. It seems to me that the separation of the two vesicles is almost
completed at the moment of the constriction of the whole. The left ve-
sicle places itself in communication with the exterior by the water-pore,
this being accomplished at the end of this pluteus stage, Pl. V, ffifiq 84.
the second day after the fecundation and before the anterior ventral
arms of the larva are formed, the suniiel-shaped oral invagination of
the conc-ave ventral surface takes place, Pl. III, fig). 41, in order to
meet the archenteron immediately after its separation from the vesicles
above mentioned.

In the stages of Pluteus, in which an age of six days has been
reached, the digestive tract is well developed and rather complicated, its
different regions being sharply distinguished. The entrance to the mouth
presents a wide, slightly depressed space, Pl. V, fig). 82-83 m, well
limited by high columnar cells and extending over a good deal of the
anterior ventral concave area of the larva. Posteriorly the mouth nar-
rows into the oesophagus, fig). 82—83 oe, which is a rather long thick-
walled tube, lined with a high ciliated columnar epithelium‚ round which
fine contr-actile fibres are to be observed, the oesophagus thus acquiring
the capability of powerful contraction. But the oesophagus is also able
to shorten, and in such a state it presents rather a spacious cavity.
Besides, the larva often repeats a powerful swaIIOW, in the course of
which a part of the gullet invaginates into the stomaohj

The gullet communicates by a wide constricted opening, dors-al
in position, with the large globular stomach, fiq. 82—83 st, which fills
up a good deal of the larval body, and is lined with not very high
ciliated cells each containing a large round nucleus. At the ventral side
of the stomach and posteriorly a round opening leads into an intestina]
sac, βιῳ. 82-83 «ν, which is obviously thin-walled and opens externally
through the blastopore, or rather anus, which is situated more in the
