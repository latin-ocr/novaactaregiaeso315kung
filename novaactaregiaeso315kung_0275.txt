common pseudopodial matrix is able to thrust out branches7 in which
the calcification takes place of such spines as are of less importance to
the larva and vari-able in position. There is but little doubt that the
calcareous deposits in other Echinoderms originate in the same way as
above described, and When I take into consideration the mode of for-
mation and growth of bone in vertebrated animals, it seems to me
very credible that the ossifying ground-substance is not formed in an
intercellular substance, but is originated by direct conversion of the
plasm of the osteoblasts.

VIII.

The development of the Pluteus.

With regard to the Pluteus in Echinocyamm, there are three sub-
sequent stages to be discerned, which are distinguished by a different
number of centres of calcification and by a gradual increase in the num-
ber of rods and arm-like appendages.

The first stay& of the Pluteus is characterized by possessing only
two centres of calcification⁷ and consequently two rods and two larval
arnis, viz. the posterior ventral ones3 besides, during the latter period of
this stage⁷ two anterior ventral arms begin to grow out. The changes
which the larva undergoes during this stage, are in short as follows. The
Gastrula curves slightly towards the ventral sursace, which becomes con-
cave‚ and its ectodermic cells flatten except at the animal pole, where
they remain high and cylindrical7 Pl. ΙΙΙ, fiy. 37—39. Then the two
first arms of the larva begin to arise. At first they appear as two small
protuberances‚ arranged symmetrically one on each side and slightly in
front of the blastopore‚ and in them a latticed rod is visible which has
protruded from the calcareous star on each side of the larva. It almost
seems as if the protuberances were caused just by the growth of the
«calcareous rods towards the ectoderm, forcing this to bulge out. The
protuberances rapidly increase so as to form the long narrow posterior
arms characteristic of this pluteus stage, Pl. V, fig). 82—85.

Forty-eight hours after the fecundation‚ the larva has reached a

total length of about O‚2 mm. and the arms have attained about half
this length, Pl. II17fi9. 40—41. At this time the ciliated band is also
