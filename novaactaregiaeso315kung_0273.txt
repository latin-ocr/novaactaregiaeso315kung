ECHINOCYAMUS PUSILLUS. 37

said I could never observe that the tetrahedron becomes visible before
at least three calciferous cells have arranged themselves in 3 heap
close to the blastoderm. But after this is done, the formation of the
tetrahedron takes place in a clear pseudopodial plasrn situated between
these cells and the ectoderm and evidently derived not from one cell
but from all the three cells, the pseudopodia of which have united into
a small clump. This clump is made discernible by staining the Bla-
stula with some suitable colouring fluid⁷ while the mucilaginous sub-
stance which fills up the blastocoel remains colourless, Pl. IV, fi9. 81.

Thus7 according to my opinion, the calcareous tetrahedron is a
result of the activity of several 00118, which deposit calcareous salts in
a liquid state in the common pseudopodial clump7 where the formation
of the tetraliedron afterwards takes place. On account of the transpa-
rency of pseudopodial plasm and the opacity of the granular main por-
tion of the cells, one gets the ilnpression that the tetrahedron is extra—
cellular in position.

According to SELENKA and SEMON the tet-rahedron not only has
originated in a single cell but also arises directly from the calcareous
granule of uncertain shape which is present in it, and which conse-
quently should form the centre in the future calcareous spicule. For
certain reasons Ι do not think this to be the case. Firstly, it may be
remembered‚ that before the formation of the tetrahedron takes place,
there are several cells heaped together in Echinocyamus, each with one
or more calcareous granules of uncertain shape. Now it seems rather
singular that only one of these granules should be transformed into
a tetrahedron, while the remaining ones are probably dissolved and
by successive depositions give rise to the further increase ofi the 03103.-
reous body. Besides, it is common to all calciferous cells to possess
such granules. For my own part I cannot explain this in any other
way, than that the calciferous cells during their lively activity supply
themselves with calcareous salts in such a degree, that it becomes im-
possible to keep them in a state of solution. A part of the dissolved
salts therefore must solidify, thus giving origin to the grandes, which
properly may be considered as reserve material, which when required
may be dissolved again and used for building up by successive concen-
tric depositions the tetrahedron as well as the future spicule.

I may now be allowed to sketch my own opinion of the way in
which the process of calcification goes on. The calciferous cells supply
themselves with calcareous matter in such abundance that a part gets
