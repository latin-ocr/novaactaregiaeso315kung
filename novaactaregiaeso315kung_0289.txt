ECHINOCYAMUs posumus. 53

ΡΖ. IX. fiy. 107, two different kinds of spines have been developed,
i. e. long true spines tapering towards the free point, and short ones
with the end broadly truncated and provided with long needles. The for-
mer occupy a space round the animal between the upper and lower sur-
faces, while the later ones protrude also from this space but principally
from the dorsal region. Resides, the truncated spines are distinguished
by a covering of long cilia, in consequence of which they may be able
to perform functions different from those effected by the long spines.
In connection with the explanation of the development of the
plates and spines, it seems suitable to give a short account of the origin
of the sphaeridia, detected and first described by LovEN¹> According
to him several forms of the Clypeastridae, and among them Echinocyamus.
have only a single spherid in each ambulacrum. As far as my experiences
go this is a mle, but in young specimens two of these sense-organs
are not seldom met with in some of the ambulacra, though in such cases
the second probably is subjected to a retroactive developmental pro—
cess. Exactly as LovEN says in his repert on Pourtalesia with regard to
Oassidulus, the spherids in Echinocyamus also are at first free and un-
covered, Pl. VIII, fiy. 106 ancl Pl. IX, fifl· 108, but become subsequently
overgrown by a calcareous net-work. It ought to be kept in mind, that
they do not become visible all simultaneously, but that those of the
trivious ambulacra first arise, the frontal portion of the young being
thus clearly marked. The origin of the spherids is as follows, ΡΖ. IX,
fi‘q. 110 a—e. Like the spines, they also appear as exceedingly small
tetrahedronS, three angles of which become bipartite so as to form a
star with six arms while the fourth grows into a small central vertical
spine. T·hiS passes at a very early stage, when the plates and spines are
still small, incomplete and enclosed within the Pluteus. The point of
the centra] spine sends out three upwardly directed rods, which are curved
and have their ends converging. One of these small deposits measures
about O,01 mm. in length, and is held upright by the star which serves
as a supporter. Then, the three rods send out near their point of origin
a process which grows downwards in order to coalesce with the arms
