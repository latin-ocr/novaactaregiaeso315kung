Not seldom Ι have seen several spermatozoa enter the egg, but
in such cases the eggs were always developed in an abnormal manner,
so that one gets aspects resembling those figured by For ¹).

'Phe segmentation of the ovum.

All that is known with regard to the phenomena of segmentation
in the eggs of Clypeastroids is confined to the »Preliminary Observations»
on the development of Echinarachnius by FEWKEs. However, seeing
that his description is brief and evidently not based on investigations
of the segmentation of the same ovum, and that, besides, the pheno-
mena of segmentation in Echinocyamus differ essentially in several
respects from those in Echinaxachnius, it will not be out of place if I
communicate the results of my own investigatione a little more in de-
tail. Of course, Ι have no intention of trying to give an account of the
internal phenomena of segmentation, viz. the metamorphosis of the nu-
cleus eto„ but only of demonstr-ating the external characters of the
segmentation which I have been able to note on the living egg.

Stadium with two segmenta

The above mentioned radiate arrangement of the plasma sur-
rounding the segmentation nucleus becomes less distinct and is finally
not traceable. The round segmentation nucleus elongates somewhat
and assumes the well-known spindle form, Pl. I, fiy. 4, the two poles,
as it often seemed to me, forming centres, each of a plasmatio radia-
tion not very distinct, Pl. I, fiy. 5. About 25 to 35 minutes after the
impregnation the contour of the nucleus becomes almost invisible and
