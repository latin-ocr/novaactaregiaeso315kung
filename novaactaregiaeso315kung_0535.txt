ΟΝ ARsENICAL PARALYSIS. 9

small, pale and indistinctly outlinech without nuclei but with rich pigment
and occasionally form only a pale mass of grains without clear outline.
Rounded celles with only a few processes are perhaps most numerous.

The white substance. No <leaena-atzam are found in the columns ex-
cepting in Goll's columns where on both sides uniformly extended degenera-
11011 is present with considerable increase of connective tissue.

The motor roots within the cord appear 111111, but no distinct
sign of degeneration is present.

Cervical swellz'nfy.
Grey substance.- The cells are here more normal in appearance

although atrophy in ones are present. The nerve fibres and colmam in
the white substance are similar to those in the cervical cord.

Goll's columns are deqeneratesl. (Fig. 1.)

5 cm. above the cauda all the same changes as regards the gang-
lion cells as above mentioned seem here to be developed. Otherwise
there is no change in either the grey or white substance. In the posterior
columns there is no distinct degeneration. In a part of the ganglion
cells in the carmine coloured cut the one half or third part seems at
times to be considerably paler than the other half.

4 cm. above tlze lower end of tlze cord at tlze point of exit of the
2⁰⁴³ lumbar nerv. (Fig. 2, 3.)

There is here on the left side of the grey substance an irregular
cavity measuring in height about 1 cm.- and in greatest diameter 1 mm.
It lies in the middle of the grey substance, just opposite the commissure.
It has uneven, ragged walls, on which a number of red blood-globules
are met with [which latter are also found in small microscopical masses
scattered about in the surrounding grey substance] and also the debris
of tissues. In the neighbourhood there are a number of vessels and
fairly near the cavity there are ganglion cells of Which some have a
rather well-preserved form. The greater number are however rounded
and have no proeesses. Owing to the hemorrhage this left cornu
has taken a different form from the right being considerably expanded
and has burst through the latera] white substance so that the grey sub-
stance extends to the periphery of the cord. Also there are here near
the periphery a number of the gang-lion cells partly atrophic. Even the
ganglion cells in the right half of the medulla are somewhat changed
and degenerated or atrophied. (Fig. 4.)
