ment of HENSEN was supported by METSCHNJKOFF‘) in his studies on
the development of the Echinoderms and Nemertines. He says in the
resume, that in many Echinoderms after the commencement of the
invagination, in Others, for instance Echinus lividus, before the invagi- .
nation takes place⁷ cells either lose their connection with the other
cells in such great numbers that they fill up the blastocoel, or they
occur in such small numbers that they are able to move by means of
the pseudopodia. Resides, it is plain from his researches that the wan-
dering cells arise either from the invaginated entoderm 01· from the
point where the invagination takes place.

Some years afterwards SELENKA ²) published his beautiful resear-
ches on the development of Holothuria tubulosa and Cucumaria planci,
where he points out that the mesenchyme originates from cells which
separate from the entoderm⁷ either during the process of invagination
from the archenteron as in the former, or before this process from the
vegetative pole of the Blastula as in the latter.

In 1879 the same author ³) published his studies on the develop-
ment of the germina] layers and of the organic system of the Echi-
noids and here he was able to state the same to be the case in no
less than five different species.

In 1883 SELENKA 4) again gives an account of the germinal layers
in some types of Echinoderms and shows that the mesenchyme- origi-
uates in the Echinoids and Ophiurids from the entoderm, and in Synapta
from the same germinal layer⁷ but not till a later stage and from the
end of the almost fully grown archenteron.

Two years afterwards METSCHNIKOFF ⁵) in his new studies on the
Echinoderms pronounced more distinctly as to the views mentioned
above. He says that the wandering cells in the Echinoderms‚ as far
as is known from the Asteroids and Echinoids, arise from the ento-
derm or from that pole of the Blastula where the entoderm becomes

invaginated.
