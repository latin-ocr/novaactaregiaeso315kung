8 HJALMAR Tnsssn,

never succeeded in finding any polar cells, these having certainly been
torn off by constrictior] from the egg inside the ovarial tubes, as is known
to be the case in other Echinoids, and then removed. FEwKEs and
NACHTRIEB also did not notice any polar cells in the two Clypeastroids,
Echinai-achnius and Mellita. However‚ Ι did not spend much time in
searching for them, considering it to be beyond the limits of this report.

As soon as the spermatozoa‚ which have a length of 0‚0‹÷ mm⁰7
Pl. J, fig). 20, have penetrated the mucilaginous investment and come
into contact with the egg itself, the latter, which hitherto has passed a
somewhat latent existence, begins to undergo a series of very interesting
processes which are well known in other Echinoderms and therefore
need not be repeated here in detail.

It is especially interesting to observe the operations of the sper—
matozoa. If a single egg be placed in a humid chamber arranged on
an object-glass and a few spermatozoa be admitted at some distance
from the egg, a very exciting display takes place under the eyes of the
observer. The spermatozoa show a high degree of vivacity and run
searching in all directions as if they had a sense of the remote ovum.
One has a distinct impression that here there must be either two attrac-
tive forces, the egg being the more power-ful, or a conscious activity
on the part of the spermatozoa.

With regard to the changes which take place in the impregnated
egg, I only refer to the following. At the place where the first sper-
matozoon has penetrated the mucilaginous investment, a very thin plas-
matio vitelline membrane rises and separates from the egg, Pl. 1,ᾒο I, ’
beginning at the place of contact and extending eventually round the
yolk, the consequence of which is that the yolk shortly appears as if
situated in the centre of a large⁷ spherical‚ sharply defined sac, the inter-
mediate space being filled up by a homogeneous transparent plasma, Pl.
I⁷ fiy. 2.

It is not yet decided whether the above membrane is present be-
fore the impregnation, or arises just at the moment of contact between
the spermatozoa and the egg. For my own part⁷ Ι am inclined to think
that a. plasma-membrane is always differentiated before the act of ferti-
lization. A† the plaoe where it first begins to rise⁷ the outline of tho
membrane does not present itself as a smooth even line but runs in un-
dulations‚ and passes distinctiy, as it appears to me, into the larger re-
maining part of the membrane, which is still closely pressed against the
yolk. It is only at a later moment that it becomes expanded and assumes
