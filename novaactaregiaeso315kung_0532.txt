6 S. E. ΗΕΝ66ΗΕΝ,

The patient 631] perform all movements in the hip joints without
restriction ancl she 631] even hold up both legs from the bed.

Contractiovns.

Both 311116 316 kept lightly bent in the elbOW-joints and cannot
166 quite outstretched. The fingers stretched in the metacarpo—phalangeal-
j0ints are kept more or less bent in the phalangeal-joints and cannot
there be quite outstretched. The knee-joints 6311 neither be fully out-
stretchech 611 attempting to do so the flexors are strained and the patient
experiences pain in and above the joint.

Tonas of tlte muscles.

The 1111166166 of the 311116, particularly the fore-arms and hands are
feehle and slack3 the strength of the 1111166166 16 greatly impaired so that
bending of the elbow-joints 6311 easely be preventecl if 6116 1661616 with
a finger. It is 1116 631116 with the legs⁷ especially the lower-legs; if one
lifts up the lower-leg the foot slips here and there and the patient 6611-
sequently cannot stand. Movements in the bip-joint are slowly effected
and without much strength3 only the fiexors of the thighs are felt to be
hard and strained,

Meclzam'cal irritabilz'ty of the muscles 16 in the arms considerably
lessened especially in the fore-arms⁷ where itis almost absent. The thigh
muscles 6311 61111 respond 16 irritation although inconsiderahly but in the
lower-leg and foot irritability 16 quite null.

Electrical irritabilz'ty of tlte muscles (only examined by faradic cur—
rent) is quite absent 111 1116 leg. From the examinatior] it seems that
irritability is less in the fore than upper-arm especially 611 the right
side, and that the thigh muscles, particularly the right are less irritable

than the fore-arms.

Electrical Irritabz’lz'ty of the meroes.

Examined by galvanio current does 1161 show any reaction of de-
generation in 1111. 3666666111 and ulnares3 n.n. ulnares seem to have 3
quantitatively somewhat diminished irritability; n.n. peronei could not
be irritated even by the strongest current.

Fibrillary musal& contractions are observable in the upper arms as
well as more particularly in the fore3 whilst on the contrary such could
not be noticed in the legs.

Cramp 111 special inuscles is not present.
