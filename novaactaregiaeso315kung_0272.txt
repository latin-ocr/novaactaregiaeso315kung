keeps to the point of one of the arms during its increase. Other me-
senchyme cells come to the points of the two remaining arms⁷ suppor-
ting them during their increase, and furthermore other cells give origin
to the branches or raniifications.

As may be understood from the above, there is some doubt as
to the meaning of SELENKA, whether he thinks that the calcareous star
retires from the originating cell or not.

SEM0N1>‚ who has also occupied himself with this problem, says
that the calcareons deposit originates in the interior of a cell as a grain
of uncertain shape and that this changes into a tetrahedron. The fur-
ther growth goes on mainly in the direction of three axes of the tetra-
hedron, the result thus being a regular three-armed star, which SEMON
now found placed outside the cell and enveloped by a thin homogeneous
membrane which he also supposes to have been effected by the calcife-
rous cell. SEMON doubts whether the calcareous star has escaped from
the cell, which he is most inclined to believe, or if it still remains there,
the cell itself having lost the nucleus and being transformed into the
investing membrane.

My own researches have led rne to the following results. The
calciferous cells, which are unenclosed in a definite cell—wall and capable
of exhibiting amoeboid movements, contain imbedded in their granu-lar-
looking endoplasm, besides various adventitious materials, one calcareous
granule or more, the outline of which is uncertain. Resides this plasm,
the cells consist of a clear homogeneous hyaloplasm or ectoplasm, to
which the more obvious activity of the cell is immediately due3 the
anioeboid movements are produced by a flowing out of this plasm, which
extends far beyond the limits of the granular plasm, thus forming the
pseudopodia. In a state of rest, when the pseudopodia are withdrawn,
the thin peripheral layer of clear plasm hardly appears to surround the
cells, which in this condition almost give the impression of being totally
granular and well defined, Pl. IV, fiffi 76.

When the tetrahedron, the first calcareous deposit of a definite
form, makes it appearance in EchinocyamUS, I never found it enclosed
within the granular main portion of the cells, but in the peripheral pseu-
dopodial plasm, which has protruded slightly towards the blastoderm,
thus appearing as if it were placed outside the cells. As I have already
