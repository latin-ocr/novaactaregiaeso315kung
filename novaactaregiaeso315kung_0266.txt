of two closely adjacent cells at the vegetative pole of the Blastula in
Toxopneustes lividus, which according to him should multiply by division,
enter into the segrnentation cavity and originate the whole mesenchyme.
However‚ some years afterwards SELENKAdegain finds the two primordial
cells, which were distinguished by their shortness from the surrounding
higher cells, in many Echinoderms viz. Strongylocentrotus lividuffiSphaer-
echinus granularis⁷ Echinus microtuberculatus⁷ Ophioglypha lacertosa and
even in Synapta digitata, although in the latter they were placed at the
end of the fully grown archenteron. On account of these observa-tiens
he believed himself justified in founding the theory, that in the Echino-
derms⁷ two primordial or arche-mesenchyme cells are present which
either are placed bilaterally at the vegetative pole of the larva (Echi-
nids and Ophiurids) or at the end of the archenteron (Synapta), and
that in the Echinoids (Asteroids‘? and Ophiurids?) they divide and give
rise to two »mesenchyme hands» homologous to the mesoblastic bands
known in the Mollusks, Worms etc, which in company With the two pri-
mordia] cells enter the blastocoel. FLssisoHMAN ¹), who has studied the
first developmental processes in Echinocardium cordatum, differs slightly
from SELENKA, insisting that there are four arche-mesenchyme cells in
that species. ”

This theory of SELENKA has been discussed by the three above
mentioned investigators7 who deny the existence of the arche-mesen-
chyme cells as well as of the mesenchyme hands. They explain that
the detruncated cells at the vegetative pole are nothing but common
blastorneres in a state of division and multiplication‚ when as a rule
they become shorter.

After this survey of the different opinions which exist with regard
to the origin of the mesenchyme‚ I may be allowed to show the re-
sults which I have gained during my own researches into the develop-
ment of Echinocyamus. In these studies 1 found it useful to examine
the larvae in a living state as well as after they had been fixed ancl
stained. The most suitable fixing fluids were FLEMMING's fluid, or a
rather dilute solution of osmic acid. ’ Besides the whole larvae, I have of
course examined many series of sections of them in their different stages
of development.

gate Blastula‚ Pl. II, fiy. 36 and Pl. III, fiy. 50—51, the cells at the
