EcmNoorAMus PUSILLUS. 17

Stadium with sioety seyments.

This cleavage stadium, which begins at about three hours after
the fecundation, is introduced by the activity of the eight »large)) macro-
meres, which become divided‚ apparently by a horizontal plane, in
sixteen equ-al segments arranged in two superposed rows. Then the
»smalh macromeres begin to divide, the lowest ones at 'the vegetative
pole⁷ as it seems to me, first taking part in the process. Lastly7 the
four ))lower>) micromeres divide into eight. However, it is worthy of
notice that- the succession of the segmentation phenomena in this sta-
dium is slightly vari-able.

The difference in size between the blastomeres is still discernible⁷
though of course not so obvious3 meanwhile the micromeres are still
minute⁷ Pl. H, βε). 30. During repeated ἀίνί8ἰοη8, however, the diffe-
rence in size gradually becomes indistinguishable.

The following table will give a view of the segmentation process

in Echinocyamus.

By way of a brief recapitulation of what has been said in the
preceding pages with regard to the process of segmentation in Echi-
nocyamus‚ I may call attention to the following results:
