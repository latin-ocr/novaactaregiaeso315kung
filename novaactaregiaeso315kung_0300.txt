, The sanie ovum as in the preceding plato, though slightly later. The segments have sepa-

rated again. seen from above.
Side view of an ovum with four segments.

, The same ovum as in figure 21, at one hour and 55 minutes after the fecundation. The

eight segments are in a state of compression against each other. Seen from above.

. The same ovum as in figure 22 though later and with eight segmenta. Side view.

The same ovum as in figure 23 at two hours and 20 minutes after the fecundation. sixteen
segments: four mioromeres. four »lai-ge» macromeres and eight »smallh macromeres.
Seen from above.

The same ovum as iu figure 24 though later and with sixteen segments. Side view.

. The same ovum as in figure :26 though later and with thirty-two segments. Side view.

Optical Section of the same ovum as in the preceding figure.

The same ovum as in figure 25 at about two hours and 35 minutes after the fecundation.
Stadium with thirty-two segments. Seen from above.

The same ovum as in the preceding figure at about three hours after the fecundation.

. Stadium with sixty segments. See-n from above.
. Ovum at about seven honre after the fecundation. The egg has changed into a Blasto-

sphere with a diameter of about 0,1 mm. Optieal seetion. Several blastomeres are in
a state of division. Stained with Grubler's aeetie aeid carmine.

Blastula at about thirteen honi-s after the fecundation, stained with Grubler's acetic aeid
carmine* Several cells are in a state of division. The cilia have protruded. The larva
is still enclosed within the mneilaginous coat. Length = O.14 mm. Breadth = 0,09 mm.

Blastula at about twenty honi-s after the fecundation. Optieal section showing how the
wandering cells loosen from the vegetative pole and arrange themselves in the bla-
stocoel. Length = 019 mm. Breadth = 0,09 mm. , ,

Young Gastruia at about twenty-five hours after the fecundation. The first pair of cal-
cal-eous deposits have arisen. Optical section. Length = 03³ mm. Breadth = 0‚0s mm.

Blastula at about twenty-five hours after the fecundation. Two calcal-eous stare have begun
to arise. Optioal section. Length = (m mm. Greatest breadth z O‚1 mm.

Blastula at about thirteen hours after the fecundation, developed from the egg repre-
sented in figure 30. Optical sectiou to show the wandering cells. The larva is still
enclosed within its mucilaginous coat.
