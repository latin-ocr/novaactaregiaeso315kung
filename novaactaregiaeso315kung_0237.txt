For a long time the development of the Echinoderms has formed the
subject of a series of splendid researches. Nevertheless, there are great
gaps to be filled up, and the following pages may serve as a contribu-
tion to extend in some more or less important points our present know-
ledge of the embryology of this very interesting group of anim-als.
JOHANN MULLER, by whom the larval forms of many Echinoderm
types were long ago excellently described and figured, first gave his
attention to some larvae and young sea-urchins‚ taken from the surface
of the sea in the neighbourhood of Heligoland, Elsinore7 Nice and Trieste,
and which he supposed to be young of Echinocyamus pusillus, the sole
representative of the order Clypeastroidea found in European waters.
This supposition has remained unconfirmed till the present time, nobody
having since published anything on the development of the animal in
question. My own researehes will prove that JOHANN MmLER was right
and that his larvae really were young forms of Echinoeyamus. However,
he only treated a few developmental stages which he ocoasionally met
with on the surface of the sea and obtained by means of a tow-net.
Except for the aooount of J. MULLER and a very fragmentary
sketch by NACHTROEB on Mellita testudinata KLEIN, only a single paper,
as far as I know, has been published treating more fully the different
phases in the embryology of a Clypeastroid‚ viz »The Preliminary Obser-
vations» on the development of Echinaraehnius parma (LAMK.> by FEWKEs.
Thus, considering the incompleteness of our present knowledge of the
development of the thinoderms in question, the following communi-
eations, though in many points themselves incomplete, may be of some
interest. And this for the additional reason that, as far as I knOW, this
is the first time the development of an Echinoid has been traced fron]

the artificially fertilized egg to the stage when the young sea-urchin has
