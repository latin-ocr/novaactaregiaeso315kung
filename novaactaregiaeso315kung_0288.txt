out three rods and takes the form of a three—armed spicule with equal
angles. Afterwards the ends of the arms are dichotomously branched,
and by a repetition of this process and the joining of the arms a plate
with large holes arises, which increases by new branches successively
protuding and uniting, fig). 97—98. In the meantime arms also begin to
grow in a vertical direction from the centra] part of the plate in order to
raise the tubercle of ealeareous network. In the way that I have just
sketched the larger interradial plates originate and grow so as to as-
sume gradually the form familiar in the young sea-urchin. In these
plates, figi. 98, which measure about 0,07 mm. in diameter, the centrally
placed meshes first brought into existence are always considerably wider
than the peripheral ones originated later.

As to the mode in which the spines develope, it will easily
be understood from the series of figures I have given, Pl. VII, fig).
,99 a—lc, for which reason I prefer to treat it very summarily. As
already mentioned, the spines, as well as the plates, begin as a minute
triangular depositor rather tetrahedron placed on the exterior side of
the increasing plate and at some distance from it. The three angles
divide each in two, and thus the deposit changes into a minute star
having six obtuse arms and measuring about 0,004 mm. in diameter.
The arms increase in length until the star has reached a diameter of
O,012 mm., after which their ends become knobbed and gradually send
out two opposite processes which unite, and now we have a wheel-shaped
deposit. Simultaneously the centre protrudes a vertical spine. The
wheel gradually changes into a spine, which has a length of O‚1 mm. in
the young sea-urchin in question. The basal portion of the spine, which
is enlarged so as to form a kind of head, becomes connected with the
plate by strong muscular fibres, which effect the movements in all the
directions of which the spines are capable. According to LUDW1G¹) the
spines in Asterina gibbosa FORBEs take their origin in the same way and
later SEMON ²) described almost the same developmental process in Ar-
bacia pustulosa etc.

As the young one grows larger, the spines increase and assume
gradually the final shape characteristic of those in the mature sea-urchin.
Thus, in the largest young ones I have succeeded in raising in my aquaria,
