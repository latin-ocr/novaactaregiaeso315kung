The Gastrula stage ¹).

At about twenty-four hours after the fecundation more or less,

according to the temperature of the water, an invagination begins to
take place at the vegetative pole, the invaginated portion becoming the
entoderm⁷ Pl. II. βιοῖ. 34 and Pl. III, fig. 37—38. The cavity of the
entoderm or archenteron, at first very minute and resembling a small
depoession, grows rapidly and becomes deeper and deeper, taking the
form of a hollow cylinder. After another twelve hours the archenteron
has attained almost its full length⁷ Pl. HI, fiq. 39, the vaso—peritoneal
vesicles being either already separated or in a state of constriction, and
even at this age the Gastrula begins to pass into the first stage of the
Pluteus. The Gastrula, like the Blastula, is characterized by its cylin-
drical form and unusual length.

The cells of the ectoderm are not closely pressed together side
by side, but rather distinct spindle-shaped spaces are to be traced be-
tween them. The cells at the animal pole are still of a marked cylindrical
shape and higher than the other cells. The cells at the vegetative pole
which also were remarkable for their length, still retain during the in-
vagination their cylindrical or club-shaped form and present not seldom.
when treated with acetic acid carmine⁷ the characteristic stages of karyo-
kinesis⁷ which show that a cell-division takes place and that the larval

1) It has been presumed that in all the Echinoderms the Gastrula is pro-
duced by an embolic invagination. However this appears not always to he the case.
In 1869 METSCHNIKOFF in his »Studien fiber die Entwickelung der Echinodermen
and Nemertimen» alluded to certain peculiarities in the larva of Amphiura squamata,
stating that the cells of the Blastula divide themselves by a process of concentric
splitting into two layers, but he did not prosecute his researches in detail. Later
APOSTOLIDES (Arch. d. zool. exper.¹ 10. 1882. p. 208) pointed out that the hypo-
blast originates in this Amphiura by delamination. Recently, RUsso (Zool. Anzeig. Nm
377, p. 405—407) has declared positively that Amphiura squamata has a Gastrula
produced by delamination. According to him, the cylindrical blastomeres become
simultaneously split into an outer more plasmatic ectoderm and an inner entoderm3
it is not till afterwards that the two vesicles are perforated at one place and this
opening is known as the blastopore.

If this be right, the continuity in the mode of the formation of the Gastrula
in the Echinoderms is broken in a very singular manner -— but further investiga-
tione are needed.
