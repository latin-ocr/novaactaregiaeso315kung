that in the Echinoderms the mesenchvme mostly has its origin from the
entoderrn, but that the ectoderm also can give rise to it. Lastly in the
year 1891 the same investigator¹) insists that the mesenchyme in Cucu-
maria planci (ε doliolum) is dne to the ectoderm as well as the ento-
derm, an opinion opposite to that expressed by SELENKA.

Finally, we must not forget a third view first pronounced by
METSCHNIKOFF in his first mentioned work, and confirmed recently by
R-USSO 2) who found in Amphiura squamata that, as soon as the two
layers of the gastrula have been produced by a process of delamination‚
the mesenehyme begins to originate by means of a new act of delami-
nation taking place in the ect.oderm³). If this statement of Russo is
right in all respectas, we have to do with a very remarkable exception
from the general rule.

If We consider the different views cf the origin of the mesenchyme
as expressed by the above authors, we find that the mesenchyme origi—
nates in three ways in the Echinoderms: viz. by immigration from the
entoderm alone in most Echinoderms‚ or by immigration from the ecto-
derm as well as from the entoderm as is the case in a few forms⁷ or
finally by a process of delamination from the ectoderrn known only in
Ainphiura squamata (and Psolinus breviSP).

Before I go on to relate my own investigat-lons with regard to
Echinocyamus⁷ I must take into consideration the opinion promulgated
by SELENKA, HATsCHEK and FtfflschAN, that the mesenchyme should
originate from only two or four cells of the entoderm named »arche-
mesenchyme cells», a view opposite to that expressed by METSOHNJKOFF,
KORsoHEL'r and Luowm.

The »arche-mesenchyme theory» is mainly due to SELENKA4).
HATcsHEK ⁵), it is true, was the first to call attention to the existence

nates by a kind of delamination, but his account of this process is not so clear as
to exclude all doubts of the correctness of his observations.
