through all the metamorphoses in captivity.

Besides, the following rese-arches should fully remove the delusion,
met with in some zoological books⁷ that the Echinocyamus is nothing
but the immature young of another Clypeastroid. Even AGAsSIz says
in his »Revision of the Echini>): »The development of the flat Oly-
peastroids and of the Scutellidae as above described is most instruc-
tive, showing that we must introduce a complete reform among such
genera as Lenita⁷ Soutellina, Runa⁷ Echinoeyamus‚ and other minute
Echinoids, which may eventually prove to be nothing but the young of
other Clypeastroids, probably of Mellita‚ seutella, Laganum, Olypeaster,
Echinanthus‚ Encope, and the like».

My studies on the embryology of Echinocyamus were carried out
at Christineberg⁷ the Swedish biological marine station, where I spent
the two summer vacations of 1890 and 1891, and Ι am greatly indebted
to its founder Professor SVEN LOVEN for having kindly placed at my
disposal not only a working-table with aquaria etc., but also the residence
of the station.

The following account is by no means complete, and consequently
it would have been desirable to put off its publication until I had had
the opportunity of renewing my visits to the west-coast of Sweden in
order to get the most obvious gaps filled up—but considering how un-
certain it is when this opportunity may occur, I prefer to publish it
now in its incomplete state.
