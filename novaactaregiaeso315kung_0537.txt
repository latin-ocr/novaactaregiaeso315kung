ΟΝ ARsENICAL PARALrs1s. 11

with these of any other known disease and, finally, it. is not easy to
say what poison the above named white powder could have been⁷ which
traveller gave the patient, under the name of fly-f00d‚ if not arsenio.
Neither is there any other causes known which could explain the paralysis.

Symptomatoloyy. Owing to the many cases of arsenio paralysis which
are to be found in literature the symptomatology for this form of paralysis
is fairly well known. Of late years also several inquirers have summed
up these symptonis froin a differential diagnostic point of view and
found that arsenio paralysis has its characteristic signs which distinguish
it from other forms of paralysis depending upon intoxication from other
poisons.

Thus arsenio paralysis has arnongst others been minutely dealt
with by CARL ALEXANDER1) in an inaugura] dissertation, by SCOLOZOUBOFF 2)
who supports himself on his own great experience gained in Russia, the
classical country for arsenio paralysis, and now recently by Essmom and
RYBALKmss).

As is the case with alcohol poisoning, according to DANA4) one
can distinguish two forms of paralysis. One of these is a pseudotabes
characterised by ataxy and disorders of sensibility and resembling the
pseudotabes which appears in alcohol intoxication and diphtheria. No
developed motor paralysis should be found in this form. (ΒΑΜ).

The other form again resembles the so called alcoholic or diph-
theritic neuritis. The simple neuritis and polyneuritis have of late years
been so often discribed that I need not here give any further account
of this form of illness. I will only point out that the symptoms of arse-
nio paralysis well agree with those of polyneuritis and thus the suppo-
sition that in the former polyneuritis exist-s even before section of such
a case is well warranted. Bnth arsenio paralysis is distinguishable by
the following characters. In the first place, amongst the symptoms di—
sorders of sensibility predorninate3 the patient suffers from paraesthesia,
severe and oontinuous pains all along the nerve trunks and anaesthesia
in the peripheral ramifications as well as hyperaesthesia. The severe nerve
pains can continue long3 anaethesia affects as it seems all forms of
sensation.
