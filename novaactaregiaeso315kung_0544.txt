terior grey substance3 and this case might in this respect be of spe-
cial interest as shownig that the grey substance is without feeling, so
long as hemorrhage has not developed slowly. (see LEYDEN‚ p. 227).

As regards the symptoms one can well ask: what role has this
hemorrhage played? On this subject it may firstly be noted that even
in ERchKi’s and RYBALKm's case where there was no trace of hemorrhage
in the cord, paralysis developed in exactly the same way, first with sen-
sory and then with motor phenomena3 but paralysis appeared in it more
gradually⁷ or on the 9ἙΙῙ day.

This may possibly depend upon a less dose of arsenio having
been taken aud the other symptorns confirm this in the casein question.

Further no difference was observed in my case in the degree
of the paralysis in the two legs nor was first one then the other leg
paralysed⁷ which could have been expected if hemor-rhage had caused
paralysis. Although it may now be difficult to solve the question with
certainty it seems to me for the reasons given and because the paralysis
of the arms occurred in the same characteristic manner as in the legs
—- that the hemorrhage met with on section was not the cause of the
paralysis of the lower limbs.

As it is held by some that sensations of pain are conducted by
the grey substance of the cord it is instructive to note that the feeling
of pain in the legs was not diminished or affected in this case.

This speaks against the theory but on the other hand slight ex-
tension of the hemorrhage renders the case not strictly conclusive.

It is further interesting to know that no disorders of bladder or
rectum were found although hemorrhage was found in the lumbar swel-
ling at the exit of the 2⁶⁰¹ lumbar nerve and this not far from the sup-
posed innervation centre of the bladder. All the other symptoms are
easily explained by degeneration of the peripheral nerves and particu—
larly the pains caused by the process there going on. Of special interest
is the circumstance that the muscular sense was little deranged excep-
ting in the hands and especially when remembering that by intoxications
there is often a pseudotabes characterised by ataxy.

Another difficult question to solve is whether changes in the me-
dulla or in the peripheral nerves should be regarded as simultaneous
or the one primary to the other. It is probable that this question can-
not be settled by this case alone but requirers examination of others
where or the peripheral nerves or ganglion cells of the spinal cord are
found degenerated.
