present themselves as ovals‚ Pl. II, fiq. 22. The principal axis of the.
future larva is indicated by the section line of the two vertical planes.

Even in this stage of the development a segmentation cavity is
present, defined by the four cells. More than once Ι have seen very
delicate connective filaments crossing the cavity from one segment to
the other. The cavity in question changes considerably in size accor-
ding as the segmen‘ts themselves vary in form and position. As will
be understood from the above statement, the blastomeres first become
separated and assume a rounded oval shape, Pl. I, ιἥρ. 16-17, thus
leaving between them a rather large cavity. The four blastomeres now
begin to press against each other and flatten, the result being that each
segment finally resembles a quadrant of a sphere with two plain sur-
faces and one convex. In this state of compression of the segments the
cavity is of course very insignificant‚ Pl. Lfiq. 18—19. Afterwards they
again become gradually separated and consequently the segmentation
cavity also increaseS‚ Pl. H, fig. 21--22.

At about one hour and 55 minutes after the fecundation an equa-
torial plane of division makes its appearance and divides the four seg-
ments into eight of fully equa-l size. The constriction makes its first
appearance at the sides which are turned towards each other. The
above mentioned changes in the form and position of the segments
take place and meanwhile the central cavity assumes a more or less
obvious ellipsoidal form⁷ Pl. II, fiy. 23—24.

Up to this stage of the development, the segmentation of the eggs
of Echinocyamus agrees in the main with that of Echinarachnius and
Mellita as described by FEWKEs ²) and NACHTROEB ²). But with regard to
the subsequent stages in the segmentation of the egg of a Clypea-
stroid‚ nothing has hitherto been known of any interest. As to Echi-
narachnius FEWKEs only says: »The segments of the 4-cell stage are,
however, not always bisected, and here appears the first indication of
an unequal segmentation», and further down, »An egg in the 32-ce11
stage was found four hours after impregnation». With regard to Mel-
lita NACHTRIEB confines himself to the following: »After eight blastomeres
