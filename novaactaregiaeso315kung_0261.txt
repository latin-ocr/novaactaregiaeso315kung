intestine increases not only by means os the process of invagination,
but also independently.

The separation of wandering cells from 1118 walls of the archenteron
10 forn] the mesenchyme is going on during the whole process of ga-
strulation, but they appear seldon] to arise from the blind end itself of
the archenteron, Pl. III, ιῙῐιςι. 52—57. The number of such cells 1110188888
considerably during the gastrulation and some of thern constitute fine
filaments connecting the ectoderm with 1118 archenteron.

However, the Gastrula also has changed in its external appearance,
which has in a certain degree been due 10 the development of the
two calcareous spicules and their increase, which will be treated more
in detail further on. From each of the two centres of calcification a
calcareous rod grows out towards the eetoderm‚ compelling this to pro-
trude, Pl. III, fly. 38, and thus giving rise 10 the first indication of the
two posterior ventral arms of the fut-ure Pluteus. At the same time 88 the
Grastrula has obtained these two obtuse promiiienceS‚ one on each side
and slightly in front of the blastopore, it undergoes other changes.
The dorsal surface becomes slightly convex, the ventral surface 011 the
contrary concave, and 1118 blastopore, which has had a termina] position,
is moved slightly forvvards on the latter surface, Pl. III, fiy. 39—41.

If We compare the Gastrula of Echinocyamus With Gastrulae of
other Clypeastroids viz. those of Echinarachnius and Mellita, it seems
to be a fact that they differ in some more or less important points, that
of the Echinocyamus being almost cylindrical, those of the other two
forms presenting apparently a spherical shape. Moreover. according to
FEWKEs ι> Echinarachnius seems quite to lack a differentiated cell-area
at 1118 animal pole, while according to NACHT'RIEB ²) Mellita is provided
with a well developed one, just as is the case with the Gastrula of
Echinocyamus.

With regard to the shape of the Gastrula in other Echinoids, dif-
ferences of more or less importance may be noted. Thus, SELENKA3)
states for instance, that in Echinus miliaris, Toxopneustes brevispi-
nosus and Strongylocentrotus lividus it is almost spherical, while in
Arbacia pustulosa and Echinocardium cordatum it is elongate and conical.
