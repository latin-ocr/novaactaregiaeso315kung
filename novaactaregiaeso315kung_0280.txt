may be minute ectoplasmic processes more or less crowded over the
free extremity of the cells, and subsequently these become either arran-
ged in groups or, as is the case in the bottle-shaped cells of the Plu-
teus and probably even in the collar-cells in the Porifera, they fuse so
as to form a ring or collar of clear plasm round the cilium.

In this stage of development we also find inside the ectoderm
irregularly brancbed pigment-cells‚ Pl. IV, fig). 71—73‚ which contain⁷
besides an accumulation of coloured pigmen‘ſtrgranules, a good many
small refracting globules and a large nucleus. Often the pigment-
cells intercommunicate by their branchos. As the larva advances in
development, it gradually deepens in colour owing 10 1119 increasing
aggregatim] of pigment-molecules. Resides, filaments and cells with
amoeboid processes connect the digestive tract with the body-wall of
the larva.

Towards the end of this developmental stage, the left vaso-peri—
toneal vesicle has pushed its way to the surface of the dorsal median
line and passed 11110 1119 water-pore.

lee second stay& of Pluteus commences to develop at eight or ten
days after the fecundation7 Pl. Vl, 86-88, supposing that the process
has gone on in a normal way⁷ and is indicated by the rise of two new
centres of calcification which originate one on each side of the larva in
the angle formed by the posterior Ventral arms and the oral portion os
the body. By the agency of 1119 mesenchyme cells a calcareous three-
armed star arises in each centre. The rods of the star pass⁷ one
slightly forwards and the other two in an opposite direction. One of
the latter, Which keeps on the Ventral surface, remains short and ends
with a small slightly perforated plata, Pl. IV, fiy. 65, while the remai-
ning one runs dorsally, gives off branches and crosses the correspon-
ding rod from the deposit of the opposite side. From the centre of
each deposit a latticed rod takes its origin, Pl. VI, fig). 86-88 y, and
extends into the posterior dorsal arms of the larva which are just be-
ginning to grow out.

Simultaneously, as the second pair of posterior larval arms pro-
trude⁷ or sometimes slightly before, an ectodermic invagination takes
place on the left side of the larva, Pl. VI, fig). 89 ιτ, presenting itself
at first as a small, well defined heap of cells. This is an indication
of the future sea—urchin.

lee third stay& of Pluteus begins at about fourteen* days after the
fecundation and is distinguished by obtaining a new unpaired centre
