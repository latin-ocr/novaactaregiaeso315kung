10 HJALMAR Tum,

The radiation of pseudopodia into the intermediate space of
normal or abnormal eggs is of course only transitory and vanishes
before the appearance of the phenomena of segmentation. As to the
origin of the pseudopodia, it appears to be in close connection with
the gradual separation of the vitelline membrane, their free ends being
attached to the membrane‚ thus constituting a series of threads⁷ which
cross the still increasing intermediate space. An examination of eggs
with large, abnormal, easily distinguishable processes convinces one that
the process takes place in the way above mentioned.

Before finishing this chapter I may as well draw attention to a
certain difference between the fertilized eggs of Echinocyamus and those
of Toxopneustes variegatus described by SELENKA ¹). He says that the
vitelline membrane is scarcely removed from the outmost layer of the
yolk7 before the mucilaginous investment begins to dissolve, and that
after five minutes no traee of it is to be detected. This is by no
means the case in Echinocyamus, because here it remains as a true
envelope during almost the whole process of segmentation, and in cer-
tain cases it also surrounds the young Blastula. But it becomes glassy
and transparent in such a high degree, that it is scarcely to be per-
ceived without reflecting on it different lights by the mirror of the
microscope or placing the eggs in some colouring fluid. Possibly the
envelope in question serves for defence during the time when the em-
bryo lacks the power of free movement.

With regard to the remaining phenomena which are in connection
with the act of maturation and fertilization, I have nothing of im-
portanee to add to what is already known. As soon as the head
of the spermatozoon enters the vitellus and is transformed into the
»male pronucleus», it rapidly increases in size and passes from the
periphery towards the centre of the egg in order to meet the »female
pronucleus». This, which at first seems almost motionless‚ starts to
meet it and finally fuses with it, the two nuclei forming together
a new nucleus, »the first segmentation nucleus», which is completed'
after about ten minutes from the beginning of the impregnation. The
protoplasm, which was first arranged in radiating lines round the »male
pronncleus» during its passage from the periphery‚ now forms round
