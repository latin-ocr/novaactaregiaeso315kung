of the sides of the stomaeh, and subsequently each of thern presents
indistinctly three portioris⁷ an anterior7 a median and a posterior, Pl.
VI⁷ fifl. 89-91, which are at first in open communication one with the
other, each vaso-peritoneal vesicle forming a single cavity. Even in
this stage, the left vesicle communicates directly with the exterior by
the madreporic canal and the water-pore situated on the dorsa] surface
and in its middle-line. I never was able to observe that the portions
of the vesicles separated completely, so as to form paired cavities as is
pronounced by METSGHNIKOFF ¹) and BURY2) to be the case in other
Echinoids. According to my experiences the right vesicle or rather
enterocoel remains undivided and its different portione never present
themselves very distinctly. The left vesicle on the contrary shows
clearly three portions, the middle one of which increases, separates gra-
dually and changes into the hydrocoel⁷ while the remaining portions be-
come the left'enterocoel. At first the madreporic can-al appears to com-
municate with the anterior portion of the left vaso—peritoneal vesicle.

it passes over to this, Pl. VI, fiy. 91. ‚

The first indication of the young sea-urchin presente itself in the
same manner as described by AGAss1z ³) and subsequently by METsCHNI-
KOFF4). In an early stage of the Pluteus⁷ when the two posterior
dorsa] arms of the larva begin to protrude‚ an ectoderrnic invagina-
tion takes place on the left side between the bases of the ventral and
dorsal posterior arms, Pl. VI, fig). 89 cc. The invaginated portion soon
assumes the shape of a small bottle, the external aperture having been
considerably narrowed, Pl. VI, fiy. 91 ιτ, and its free expanded end grows
towards the hydrocoel in order to meet it. While this is going on, the
hydrocoel itself also increases and is finally placed side by side with
the invaginated sac, which has attained a noticeable size and gradually
become compressed so as to change into a rounded disc built up of
two layers, of which the under one is very thick while the upper is thin
