rapidly in number. The process causes no great trouble, because

the larvae as a rule live near the¹ surface or at least at some di-

stance from the bettoni. Resides, it is not difficult to adjust the

thickness of the siphon so as to effect the least possible suction.

After this, the aquarium may be filled up to the height desired

with a fresh supply of filtered water fetched from the open sea.

6) Lastly, the temperature in the laboratory ought not to be too
high, for which reason it is not advisable to place the aquaria in
sunny rooms.

It was not till I had availed myself of all these precautions that
I succeeded in inducing larvae of Echinocyamus to complete their deve-
lopment from the egg to the young sea-urchins which crawled about in
great numbers at the bottom of the aquarium. Itis evident that the
larvae found these arrangements agree with them. They always retained
their vivacity and their power of rising and descending in the water,
and acquired the normal quantity of piginent. If they were disperses]
by stirring the water, they gathered shortly again into masses resembling
bands or festoons which stretched downwards from the surface, each
individua] changing its place by moving vertically up or down iu the water.
Besides, the more advanced larvae even swam freely in a horizontal di-
rection. The sense of affinity of these larvae is singular to see⁷ since
when they have been dispersed in all directions, they gather again in
, a short time so as to form shoals. This is not due to the currents in
the water, as one is inclined to believe to be the case in the open sea,
because if the water in the aquarium for several days has been perfectly
still, one will find that the larvae in question change ‘their places and
almost always present themselves congregat-ed in shoals.

If it had been possible to prolong my stay at the sea-side, I am
fully convinced that I should have been able to get young sea-urchins
several months older which had been hatched in the aquaria, because
as soon as they have attained this stage in their development, they
display a high degree of vigour and strength. The fact is that they
have gained effective defensive weapons against their enemies, such as
calcareous plates⁷ feet and spines which are movable in all directions by
means of strong muscles.

The time which passes froin the fertilization of the egg till the
larva has reached the developmental stage when it becomes able to crawl
about the bottom, is about two months. The fertilization took place
during the last days of June, and the young sea-urchins had attained
