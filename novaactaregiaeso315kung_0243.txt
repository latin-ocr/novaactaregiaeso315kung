ECHINOCYAMUS PUSILLUS. 7

ΙΙ.

The ovum, its maturationi and impregnation.

The immature but full-sized egg, taken from the ovarial tubes, has
a diameter of 0,12 mm. including its enveloping mucilaginous coat. It
consists of a finely granulated, light yellowish yolk With a more trans—
parent and homogeneous peripheral layer, and contains a rather large
eccentric germinal vesicle with a diameter of 0706 mm.‚ a well deve-
loped protoplasniic nuclear reticulum and a round eccentric germinal
spot measuring from 0,008 mm. to O‚012 mm. in diameter. Resides, the
vitellus is enveloped in a glassy mucilaginous coat With slightly uneven
contours and a thickness of from 0,004 mm. to O,008 mm. Though Ι exa-
mined this coat with the highest power⁷ I never succeeded in distin-
guishing any distinct structure in it⁷ and consequently there can be no
true zona radiata in Echinocyamus. On the contrary, the envelope often
appeared finely striated in a concentric manner.

These unripe eggs are closely packed together in the genital
tubes and only separated from each other by the glassy envelope, and “
from a section of such a tube we learn that they have a more or less
irregular rounded or oval form.

The ripe ovarial egg is slightly larger, about One mm. in diameter.
Its enveloping coat swells considerably⁷ acquiring a thickness of up to
0‚032 mm. or more, and assumes such a degree of transparency that it
becomes almost invisible, being traceable only by the action of some
colouring matter. The »beautiful‚ spherical or sometimes angular‚ red
pigmented spots»⁷ which FEWKEs1) has found in the »viscous layer» of
the eggs of Echinarachnius and NACHTRIEB 2) also in the ova of Mellita,
do not exist in the eggs of Echinocyamus. The yolk of the ripe ovum
is rather transparent and finely granulated with uniformly distributed
deutoplasm, and its very thin peripheral layer of clearer protoplasm is
surrounded by a delicate membrane with apparently double contour. Ι
