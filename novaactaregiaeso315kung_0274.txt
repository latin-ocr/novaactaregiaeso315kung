solidified in the shape of reserve granules while 1116 rest remains in
fluid form. When the formation of a deposit is going to begin, the
calciferous cells combine by means of their clear pseudopodial peripheral
plasm protruding and flowing together, thus constituting a common
clump of clear living plasm outside the granular main portioris of the
cells and between these 'and the blastula-wall. This pseudopodial clump
forms the organic ground-substance, in which the calcification takes place,
caloareous salts in fluid form being continuously carried to it and there
converted into solid form. During the act of solidifying in this organic
ground substance, the resulting calcareous body assumes by degrees the
shape of a tetrahedron, which gradually increases in size by concentric
deposition of 63116, layer upon layer, and changes into a small three-
armed star.

The further increase of this early calcareous body is effected by
the activity of the same calciferous cell, the granular main portion of
which may 116 31116 10 change its place along the arms of the out-
growing spicule, as well as by new cells arriving and entering into
communication with the original common pseudopodial 11136111, which

investment. The junction between the primitive calciferous cells and
the additional ones takes place of course in the same way as above
mentioned, by their peripheral clear plasm coalescing and getting mixed
with the membrane-like plasm investing the increasing deposit, the re-
sult being that all 1116 calciferous cells cooperate in forming the organic
ground-substance for the outgrowing spicule and in providing this sub-
stance with new calcareous salts 111 liquid form, which subsequently be-
come deposited round the spicule. 2

Thus we see that the calcifying matrix, originatecl from the 6010-
11136111 of many calciferous cells, predetermines the form of the increa-
sing deposit and gives rise to the organic substance in the deposit as
well as to the 111111 0031 or membrane which invests it. Besides, 1116

full-sized spicules they become rare in such a degree, that one is
tempted to suppose that they have parted from the calcifying matrix in
order 10 constitute subsequently new centres of calcification.

As a rule, calciferous cells are present at such parts of the in-
creasing spicule, where branches protrude, apparently caused by them,
but this seems 1101 always to be the case in the formation of unimpor-
tant spines. This fact cannot be explained otherwise, than that the
