12 S. E. Hauseanu,

Disorrlers of motilz'ty are certainly met with in all four extremities‚
hut the lower 1101110 010 by far the most severely seized with paralysis
and the fact is particularly striking if the hands and feet are principally
attacked and certain authors have remarked that the extensors are espe-
cially changed in nutrition and functions.

This 0100111001 paralysis agrees with the 01001 00011110 10 11101 respect,
that neither the psychical functions nor the cranial nerves are altered3
and that the bladder and rectum work normally.

The paralysis seldom terminates in death3 00 1110 contrary the prog-
nosis of the some times very severe paralysis is very good, even if the
paralysed members in severe cases 110 restored very late.

After this short review of the characters of the arsenical para-
lysis, it will be interesting 10 look at the symptoins of the above case.

Already 5 to 6 hours after taking arsenio, very pronounced symp-
toms of intoxication‚ vomiting and burning heat in the throat⁷ appeared.
The following day diarrhoea mixed with blood came to and now the first
signs of 1111101100 of the sensibility shewed that the peripheral nerves
were attacked. Pat. felt pricking sensation in hands and feet. On the
third day was already motor paralysis in the foot-joints performed, some
day later phenomena of motor 1111101100 of the fingere appeared in forme
of witeliings. The paralysis extended 0000 10 1110 01010 and general
wealzness and atrophy entered, anaesthesia in hands- and fore-arms came
soon⁷ whilst the paraesthesia and pains continued.

The patient must on account os the paralysis be fed and could
not 100170 1101· bed.
From the braiu7 bladder and rectum 110 symptoms were observable.

In april the pains and pris-,king sensation still continued but para—
lysis in the arm had lessened-aud the patient could feed herself but not
cut her food3 the legs remained paralysed. Feeling was considerably de-
preciated‚ also the sense'of touch and temperatur-e, but 0011110 muscular
sense excepting in the hands.

The movements of the muscles shewed no ataxia but slight con—
tractions had developed. The mechanical as well as electricalirritability
was much diminished and in the peroneal region no twitchings could
be produced either by faradic or galvanio current, fibrillary muscle
twitchings existed. No reflexes could be produced from the patella or
planta pedis.
